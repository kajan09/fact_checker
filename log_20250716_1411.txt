If you stop breathing after exhalation for one and a half minutes, five times more blood flows into the brain and to the heart. This one has never been shown. And now it has been shown through these breathing techniques. I mean, this really goes so deep, we are able to change our blood chemistry. We breathe. Like 30 times like this, you become a little bit dizzy. Why? Because the CO2 levels go way down. You blow it off. Carbon dioxide.

Primary heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: The intertwined pathophysiology and treatment of some of the most relevant phenotypes. [Article in English, Portuguese] Ono R(1), Menezes Falcão L(2). Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba Japan. (2)Academic Medical Center of Lisbon (CAML), Cardiovascular Center of the University of Lisbon (CCUL@RISE), Faculty of Medicine of the University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal. Electronic address: luizmfalcao@sapo.pt. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is characterized by diverse underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and can be divided into two subgroups based on the identification of the specific cause: primary and secondary HFpEF. Primary HFpEF is caused by primary impairments in myocardial relaxation or compliance with the contribution of several risk factors. Therefore, we have reviewed current literature on pathophysiology and treatment in patients with primary HFpEF. Patients with primary HFpEF represent specific "phenotypes" and are usually elderly, more commonly women, and often with a history of arterial hypertension, obesity, iron deficiency (ID), coronary artery disease (CAD), sleep apnea, diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and chronotropic incompetence. Some of the main pathophysiological mechanisms for each phenotype of primary HFpEF are as follows: arterial hypertension, which promotes left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis; obesity, which contributes through systemic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation; aging, which leads to ventricular-vascular stiffening; gender differences, with women experiencing changes due to smaller heart size and hormonal shifts; ID, which affects mitochondrial function; CAD, which impairs myocardial blood flow; diabetes, which is associated with hyperglycemia, lipotoxicity, insulin resistance, and microvascular rarefaction; CKD, which leads to hypertension, metabolic disturbance, systemic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction; sleep apnea, which induces cardiac changes through pressure swings and hypoxia; and chronotropic incompetence, which is due to reduced cardiac β-receptor responsiveness. In conclusion, each factor intricately contributes to the complex pathophysiology of HFpEF. Understanding these interrelated mechanisms is critical for tailoring management strategies to improve outcomes in HFpEF patients. Copyright © 2025 Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This review article by Ono and Menezes Falcão (2025) summarizes the pathophysiology and treatment approaches for primary heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The authors conducted a literature review to characterize patients with primary HFpEF, who are typically elderly, more often female, and frequently have comorbidities including arterial hypertension, obesity, iron deficiency, coronary artery disease, sleep apnea, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and chronotropic incompetence. The review details the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with each comorbidity, highlighting how arterial hypertension promotes left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis, obesity contributes through systemic inflammation, aging causes ventricular-vascular stiffening, iron deficiency affects mitochondrial function, and so on. The authors conclude that understanding these complex, interrelated mechanisms is crucial for personalized management strategies in HFpEF. This review does not present original data; it synthesizes existing literature. A limitation is the absence of quantitative data or meta-analysis of clinical outcomes.

Author information: (1)Tulane University School of Medicine (2)Stanford University (3)Harvard Medical School Hypovolemic shock is a life-threatening condition caused by a significant reduction in blood volume, which prevents the heart from pumping enough blood to meet the body’s needs. Hypovolemia leads to inadequate tissue perfusion and hypoxia and can quickly progress to organ dysfunction or failure if not promptly addressed. Common causes include significant blood loss from trauma, childbirth complications, or internal bleeding, as well as severe dehydration from poor fluid intake, vomiting, diarrhea, or burns. Patients typically present with a rapid heart rate, shallow breathing, weakness, confusion, decreased urine output, low blood pressure, cold and clammy skin, anxiety, sweating, and pale skin color. Treatment focuses on rapidly restoring blood volume and stabilizing vital functions through intravenous fluid resuscitation, blood transfusions when needed, medications to support blood pressure and cardiac output, and, in some cases, surgical intervention to control active bleeding. Diagnosis is based on a physical examination, including assessment of vital signs, skin condition, and mental status, as well as blood tests such as urinary sodium levels, serum lactate levels, complete blood count, chemistry panels, and coagulation studies to determine the cause and severity. Prompt, effective treatment is essential to improve survival and prevent complications, as prolonged or severe hypovolemic shock significantly increases the risk of organ failure and death.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This StatPearls article by Taghavi, Nassar, and Askari (2025) describes hypovolemia and hypovolemic shock. It is a review article intended to provide a general overview of the condition, rather than reporting results of original research. The article details the pathophysiology of hypovolemic shock, which arises from a significant reduction in blood volume leading to inadequate tissue perfusion. Common causes are listed as trauma, childbirth complications, internal bleeding, and severe dehydration. Typical patient presentations include rapid heart rate, shallow breathing, weakness, confusion, decreased urine output, low blood pressure, and clammy skin. Treatment strategies discussed involve intravenous fluid resuscitation, blood transfusions, medications to support blood pressure and cardiac output, and potential surgical intervention. Diagnosis relies on physical examination (vital signs, skin assessment, mental status) alongside laboratory tests (urinary sodium, serum lactate, complete blood count, chemistry panels, coagulation studies). The authors note that prompt and effective treatment is crucial to improve survival and mitigate the risk of organ failure and death associated with prolonged or severe hypovolemic shock. No original data or effect sizes are presented. The article's limitations are inherent to its nature as a review; it does not present findings from a specific study population.

Time courses for pulmonary oxygen uptake and cardiovascular responses are similar during apnea in resting humans.

Author information: (1)Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. (2)Department of Health Sciences, Mid Sweden University, Sundsvall, Sweden. (3)Department of Biology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. INTRODUCTION: The pulmonary oxygen uptake is reduced during apnea, compared to eupneic baseline, preserving the pulmonary oxygen store. This study elucidates the time course for this reduction, comparing it to the time course for apnea-induced cardiovascular responses. METHODS AND RESULTS: Experiments involved two groups, performing apneas during rest, both without and with cold-water face immersion (A and AFI). The first group (n = 18) performed A and AFI of gradually increasing durations (from 15 to 120 s, order unknown to participant), allowing analysis of the time course for apneic pulmonary gas exchange. The second group (n = 18) performed A and AFI of identical durations (mean: 137 s), allowing analysis of cardiovascular and respiratory responses. The time course for pulmonary oxygen uptake was similar to the time courses for heart rate and cardiac output, i.e., following a brief increase from eupneic baseline during the initial 15 s of A and AFI, the oxygen uptake was gradually reduced during apnea, reaching a sub-eupneic level from 30 s of apnea and onwards. Changes were augmented during AFI compared to A. Observations confirmed that cardiovascular responses to apnea, including a reduced cardiac output, reduced peripheral blood flow, and most likely a peripheralization of blood volume, preserved the pulmonary oxygen store, while the peripheral venous oxygen stores were depleted to a greater extent. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the central, pulmonary oxygen store is preserved with augmented cardiovascular responses to apnea, at the expense of peripheral venous oxygen stores, with a time course similar to that of the cardiovascular responses.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study investigated the temporal relationship between pulmonary oxygen uptake and cardiovascular responses during apnea in humans. Two groups of 18 participants each performed apneas (A) and apneas with cold-water face immersion (AFI) of increasing durations (15-120 seconds) in a randomized order. The primary outcome was the time course of pulmonary oxygen uptake, compared to cardiovascular responses (heart rate and cardiac output). Results showed that pulmonary oxygen uptake initially increased briefly from baseline during the first 15 seconds of both A and AFI, then gradually decreased during apnea, reaching sub-eupneic levels from 30 seconds onwards. This pattern mirrored the time course of heart rate and cardiac output. Cold-water face immersion augmented these changes. The authors conclude that preservation of the central pulmonary oxygen store is linked to cardiovascular responses such as reduced cardiac output and peripheral blood flow, which likely contribute to peripheral oxygen depletion. A limitation is the randomized order of apnea durations, which may have introduced bias.

Judenherc-Haouzi A(1)(2), Lewis T(2), Reinhardt A(2), Haouzi P(3)(2). Author information: (1)Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States. (2)Department of Neuroscience, Lerner Research Institute, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States. (3)Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States. We sought to determine how the balance between O2 delivery (Do2) and O2 consumption is altered by fentanyl during the initial and the most critical period following a bolus intravenous injection of high-dose fentanyl. We determined the acute changes in ventilation, gas exchange, and hemodynamic-including cardiac function-along with the acid-base and arterial blood gas status-in 27 unsedated rats, following an intravenous bolus injection of 150 µg/kg fentanyl. This injection produced an immediate coma and central apnea, followed by the emergence of a regular and sustained, yet very depressed, breathing pattern ∼2.5 min later. All rats displayed an instantaneous and profound decrease in Q̇c (from 295.7 ± 42.62 to 140.74 ± 74.96 mL/kg/min; P < 0.0001) resulting from abrupt bradycardia (from 333.3 ± 20.8 to 112.2 ± 36.4 beats/min; P < 0.05) with a transient decreased cardiac contractility, associated with very severe hypoxemia that persisted throughout the ensuing period of hypoventilation, for example, [Formula: see text] = 39.0 ± 18.4 mmHg; [Formula: see text] = 50.1 ± 26.2%, at 5 min. Do2 was therefore immediately decreased by several folds; and the abrupt decrease in Q̇c was even more severe than the drop in oxygenation. Twenty-four rats survived; the three remaining animals presented a rapid cardiac arrest by pulseless electrical activity. Fentanyl overdose induces an instant decrease in Do2, with a very early and predominant drop in Q̇c, out of proportion with the decrease in V̇o2, a protective mechanism produced by hypoxemia. The relevance and translation of these findings to human hypoxic cardiac arrest are discussed.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Fentanyl overdose induces an instant decrease in arterial transport of O2, with a very early drop in cardiac output, out of proportion of O2 requirement. These results point to the prominent role of the cardiac (through bradycardia) and circulatory effects of fentanyl as major contributors to the lethality of a fentanyl overdose when apnea and hypoventilation-induced hypoxemia develop.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study investigated the physiological effects of high-dose fentanyl in a rat model of overdose. Twenty-seven unsedated rats received an intravenous bolus injection of 150 µg/kg fentanyl. The study assessed ventilation, gas exchange, hemodynamics (including cardiac function), acid-base status, and arterial blood gas values. Following injection, rats immediately entered a comatose state with central apnea, followed by a depressed breathing pattern after approximately 2.5 minutes. A significant and immediate decrease in cardiac output (Q̇c) was observed (from 295.7 ± 42.62 to 140.74 ± 74.96 mL/kg/min; P < 0.0001), attributable to bradycardia (from 333.3 ± 20.8 to 112.2 ± 36.4 beats/min; P < 0.05) and transiently reduced cardiac contractility. This resulted in a substantial decrease in oxygen delivery (Do2) which was more severe than the decrease in oxygen consumption (V̇o2). Severe hypoxemia persisted throughout the period of hypoventilation. Three rats experienced pulseless electrical activity arrest. Twenty-four rats survived. The study suggests that cardiac and circulatory effects, particularly bradycardia-induced reduction in cardiac output, are major contributors to fentanyl overdose lethality in conjunction with apnea and hypoxemia.

(2)Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering Boise State University. (3)Department of Respiratory Care Boise State University. BACKGROUND: Approximately 3,500 infants die of a sleep-related incident a year in the United States. Although safe sleep guidelines have been implemented, infants are still at risk from many commercial products. Breathing-related injuries or suffocation are of serious concern for younger infants exposed to soft product materials, yet respiration-related measures of these common materials are unknown. METHODS: Nine healthy young adults' respiratory patterns were evaluated while breathing into materials commonly used in infant products. Breathing rate, end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2), heart rate, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) were collected using a Capnostream 35. Participants lay prone with their faces in contact with each material for ten-minute trials. Three baseline trials, where participants could breathe freely with no obstruction, were collected for comparison (ANOVA (p < 0.05), Tukey post-hoc comparisons). RESULTS: The 100% cotton and 50/50 (cotton/polyester) materials both resulted in significant changes in EtCO2 and SpO2, while the 10/90 (spandex/polyester) resulted in only a significant change in SpO2, and no significant changes were detected for the 100% polyester material. Mean respiratory rate decreased and mean heart rate increased significantly for all materials. DISCUSSION: EtCO2 and SpO2 are important considerations for suffocation risk when breathing into the selected materials. Even during this short time period, infants with more vulnerable respiratory systems and less robust arousal responses than the adults in this study will be at higher risk. CONCLUSION: Conscious efforts should be made to prevent infants from interacting with soft goods microenvironments that inhibit normal breathing while using infant products.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study investigated the respiratory effects of common infant product materials on healthy adults. Nine young adult participants completed ten-minute prone trials breathing into five materials: 100% cotton, 50/50 cotton/polyester, 10/90 spandex/polyester, and 100% polyester. Baseline trials with unobstructed breathing were also performed for comparison. Respiratory rate, end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2), heart rate, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) were measured. 

Results showed that 100% cotton and 50/50 cotton/polyester materials significantly altered EtCO2 and SpO2 levels. The 10/90 spandex/polyester material significantly impacted SpO2 alone. All materials caused significant decreases in respiratory rate and increases in heart rate compared to baseline. The 100% polyester material did not result in significant changes. The authors suggest that even short-term exposure to some materials may pose a risk to infants, particularly those with less robust respiratory responses. The study’s limitation is that the findings were based on adult participants and may not directly reflect infant physiology.

Characteristics and Outcomes of Cancer Patients Admitted to the Hospital With Community- Acquired Pneumonia. Al-Saleh A(1), Hassouneh D(1), Dhaydel S(1), Faqeer N(1). Author information: (1)Department of Pharmacy, King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, Jordan. OBJECTIVES: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) poses a significant risk of complications in cancer patients. However, limited studies have evaluated hospitalised cancer patients with CAP. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of cancer patients hospitalised with CAP. METHODS: This retrospective study included adult cancer patients diagnosed with CAP admitted at the King Hussein Cancer Center, Jordan, from January 2021 to August 2022, following the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Patient characteristics, microbiological cultures, length of hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) transfers and all-cause mortality were recorded. Early clinical stability was defined as temperature ≤37.8°C, heart rate ≤100 beats/min, respiratory rate ≤24 breathes/min, systolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg and oxygen saturation ≥90% while breathing room air on the third day of admission. RESULTS: A total of 632 cancer patients were admitted with CAP. The mean age was 60 ± 13.9 years, with 55.2% of the patients being male. Breast cancer was the most prevalent malignancy (22.9%), and 48.6% had received cancer-related treatment within the last 2 months. Positive blood and sputum cultures were detected in 12.4% and 30.0% of patients, respectively. Early clinical stability was achieved in 48.9%, and 88.9% of those patients were discharged after a median stay of 6 days (range: 1-48). Among the included patients, 3.2% required ICU transfer, and 10.9% died. CONCLUSIONS: Early clinical stability was achieved in approximately half of the patients, most of whom were discharged home. Future research should identify interventions to improve clinical outcomes for cancer patients with CAP. © The Author(s) 2025.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This retrospective study investigated characteristics and outcomes in cancer patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) at the King Hussein Cancer Center in Jordan between January 2021 and August 2022. Researchers analyzed data from 632 adult cancer patients meeting criteria for CAP, following Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Data collected included patient demographics, microbiological cultures (blood and sputum), length of hospital stay, ICU transfers, and all-cause mortality. Early clinical stability was defined by specific temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation values on day three of admission. The mean age of participants was 60 years (SD 13.9), and 55.2% were male. Positive blood and sputum cultures were found in 12.4% and 30.0% of patients, respectively. Approximately 48.9% achieved early clinical stability, with a median hospital stay of 6 days (range 1-48) for this subgroup. ICU transfer occurred in 3.2% of patients, and mortality was observed in 10.9%. The authors concluded that further research is needed to identify interventions to improve outcomes for this patient population. A limitation of the study is its retrospective design.

Brain Weight Effect of Ambrisentan in Juvenile Rat Toxicity Studies Associated With Breathing Sounds, Apnea, and Sustained Hypoxemia. Laffan SB(1), Loren K(1), Takahito K(1), Sandra T(1). Author information: (1)GlaxoSmithKline, In Vitro In Vivo Translation, Collegeville, Pennsylvania, BACKGROUND: Ambrisentan is a selective endothelin-1 receptor antagonist marketed for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adults, adolescents, and children above 8 years old. METHOD: A juvenile toxicity study conducted to support clinical studies in patients under 8 years old dosed rats from postnatal days 7 to 62. In subsequent investigative studies, respiratory function was assessed by ventilatory parameters and arterial blood gases, along with other endpoints. RESULTS: Noisy breathing occurred, and brain weight was lower (4%, p < 0.05) without histologic changes at the highest dose (20 mg/kg/day). Respiratory sounds described as clicking noises seemingly synchronous with the breathing cycle were sustained. Hypoxemia and hypercapnia associated with apneic times occurred, suggesting an intermittent physical airway blockade. CONCLUSION: It's postulated that the brain weight decrease was mediated by sustained hypoxemia during a period of rapid brain growth. Improper interaction of rat laryngeal tissues, in close apposition during early postnatal stages, may constitute a sensitive period. Clinical relevance is unknown; palatal/laryngeal maturation timing in healthy children supports up to ~2 years as the period for any potential risk. However, for children with PAH, chronic hypoxemia and/or concomitant conditions associated with developmental delay could hypothetically extend the sensitive age period for potential risk through the third year of life. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study investigated the effects of ambrisentan exposure in juvenile rats to support clinical studies in children under 8 years old. Rats (postnatal days 7-62) were administered ambrisentan at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. Respiratory function was assessed via ventilatory parameters and arterial blood gases. The primary finding was a statistically significant decrease in brain weight (4%, p < 0.05) at the highest dose, without observed histological changes. Concurrent observations included noisy breathing (described as clicking noises), apneic episodes, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia, suggestive of intermittent airway obstruction. The authors propose a link between the brain weight reduction and sustained hypoxemia during a period of rapid brain growth. A limitation is the use of a single rat model, which may not fully translate to human physiology. The clinical relevance of these findings is currently unknown, although the authors suggest a potential window of risk based on the timing of palatal/laryngeal maturation, potentially extending to age 3 in children with PAH or developmental delay.

Electronic address: gnino@childrensnational.org. As survival rates for premature infants improve, understanding the link between prematurity and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has become critical for enhancing outcomes in this high-risk population. Children born severely prematurely face a threefold increased risk of developing OSA due to anatomical and physiological factors, such as an abnormal upper airway, unstable ventilatory control, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and increased susceptibility to respiratory infections. The multisystemic impact of prematurity also increases the likelihood of adverse OSA outcomes, such as neurodevelopmental deficits and pulmonary hypertension, generating a "Perfect Storm" for children affected by both conditions. Here, we summarize new insights into the shared pathophysiological mechanisms linking prematurity and OSA, highlighting the need to identify and characterize OSA in all premature infants. Polysomnographic assessments of sleep-disordered breathing and ventilatory responses to hypoxia/hyperoxia may enable tailored oxygen saturation targets for supplementation and weaning, based on each infant's unique physiology rather than relying on generalized protocols.

Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Mass General Brigham, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA pnovak2@bwh.harvard.edu. (2)Department of Neurology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. OBJECTIVE: To characterise the haemodynamic profile of supine reflex syncope triggered by a needle insertion. METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated consecutive patients with orthostatic intolerance who completed autonomic testing at Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital between 2016 and 2024 and developed supine syncope induced by needle insertion. Tests included deep breathing, Valsalva manoeuvre, head-up tilt and skin biopsies for small fibre quantification. We continuously recorded cerebral blood flow velocity from the middle cerebral artery using transcranial Doppler, along with end-tidal CO2, ECG and beat-to-beat blood pressure. The skin at the leg was anaesthetised with 0.5 mL of 1% lidocaine for biopsy. RESULTS: The needle insertion triggered syncope in five out of 4876 (0.1%) patients. Following a latency of 56 s, participants reported typical symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion (light-headedness, visual change, dyspnoea) that culminated in a brief loss of consciousness. These symptoms were accompanied by a progressive decrease in heart rate, blood pressure, mean cerebral blood flow velocity, hyperventilation and widening of the transcranial signal (systolic-diastolic difference). Syncope type was mixed into two, cardioinhibition without asystole in one and cardioinhibition with asystole in two patients. DISCUSSION: Supine syncope triggered by a needle insertion is associated with cardioinhibitory (characterised by bradycardia), vasodepressor (characterised by vasodilatory hypotension) and cerebral arteriolar vasodilatory (characterised by transcranial signal widening) responses. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

Military and/or emergency services personnel may be required to perform high-intensity physical activity during exposure to elevated inspired carbon dioxide (CO2). Although many of the physiological consequences of hypercapnia are well characterized, the effects of graded increases in inspired CO2 on self-paced endurance performance have not been determined. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of 0%, 2%, and 4% inspired CO2 on 2-mile run performance, as well as physiological and perceptual responses during time trial exercise. Twelve physically active volunteers (peak oxygen uptake = 49 ± 5 mL·kg-1·min-1; 3 women) performed three experimental trials in a randomized, single-blind, crossover manner, breathing 21% oxygen with either 0%, 2%, or 4% CO2. During each trial, participants completed 10 min of walking at ∼40% peak oxygen uptake followed by a self-paced 2-mile treadmill time trial. One participant was unable to complete the 4% CO2 trial due to lightheadedness during the run. Compared with the 0% CO2 trial, run performance was 5 ± 3% and 7 ± 3% slower in the 2% and 4% CO2 trials, respectively (both P < 0.001). Run performance was significantly slower with 4% versus 2% CO2 (P = 0.046). The dose-dependent performance impairments were accompanied by stepwise increases in mean ventilation, despite significant reductions in running speed. Dyspnea and headache were significantly elevated during the 4% CO2 trial compared with both the 0% and 2% trials. Overall, our findings show that graded increases in inspired CO2 impair endurance performance in a stepwise manner in healthy humans.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study investigated the impact of graded hypercapnia on endurance exercise performance in healthy adults. Twelve physically active volunteers (12 total, 3 women, peak oxygen uptake 49 ± 5 mL·kg-1·min-1) participated in a randomized, single-blind, crossover trial with three experimental conditions: 0%, 2%, and 4% inspired CO2. Participants completed a 10-minute walk followed by a self-paced 2-mile treadmill run under each condition. 

Run performance was significantly slower in the 2% (5 ± 3% slower) and 4% (7 ± 3% slower) CO2 trials compared to the 0% CO2 control (both p < 0.001). The 4% CO2 trial resulted in a significantly slower run time compared to the 2% CO2 trial (p = 0.046). Ventilation increased with increasing CO2 levels. Dyspnea and headache were also significantly elevated in the 4% CO2 trial compared to the 0% and 2% trials. One participant did not complete the 4% CO2 trial due to lightheadedness. The study concludes that increasing inspired CO2 impairs endurance performance in a stepwise manner.

Human otoliths, primarily formed from salts of calcium and carbonate, are different from bones of the skeleton, which are composed of calcium phosphate. The echinoderms, which share the earliest common ancestor with us, began to protect the body by making an endoskeleton out of calcium and carbon dioxide dissolved in the sea. In subsequent vertebrates, aerobic respiration supported strong muscle activity, but an occasional shortage of oxygen led to low pH due to the accumulation of lactate produced by anaerobic respiration, increasing the risk of melting bones composed of calcium carbonate. So, all vertebrates used calcium phosphate to increase bone strength, having a stronger ionic bonding than calcium carbonate. But otoliths, which are in the inner ear and thereby not connected to muscles, still use calcium carbonate. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a disorder in which otoliths detached from the utricle enter the semicircular canals and cause a sense of rotation. Otoliths, the calcium carbonate ear bones retaining a long evolutionary history, can be easily broken at low pH. During sleep, shallow breathing produces mild respiratory acidosis and low pH in the blood. Since otoliths are corroded at low pH during nighttime, BPPV occurs frequently in the morning. In addition, diabetes mellitus or gout often decreases pH in the blood and increases the occurrence of BPPV. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This article presents a hypothesis regarding the etiology of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The authors propose that BPPV arises from the fragility of otoliths (inner ear structures composed of calcium carbonate) which are susceptible to dissolution at lower pH levels. The hypothesis is grounded in evolutionary biology, noting that while vertebrate bones transitioned to calcium phosphate for increased strength, otoliths retained the ancestral calcium carbonate composition due to their lack of muscular connection. The authors theorize that shallow breathing during sleep, leading to mild respiratory acidosis and decreased blood pH, may contribute to otolith detachment and subsequent BPPV, particularly in the morning. Furthermore, conditions such as diabetes mellitus and gout, which are associated with lower blood pH, are suggested to increase the risk of BPPV. This is a theoretical paper proposing a hypothesis, and does not report data from original research or clinical trials. It does not describe a study population or specific outcome measures. The authors acknowledge the evolutionary basis of their proposition, but do not present empirical evidence to directly test their hypothesis.

INTRODUCTION: Previous research has shown that a rapid drop in inhaled carbon dioxide (CO₂) partial pressure reduces cerebral blood flow and may induce faintness - the 'CO₂-off' effect. The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of performing Valsalva manoeuvres while experiencing the 'CO₂-off' effect and whether symptoms occur that are sufficient to jeopardise submarine tower escape. METHODS: Twenty male volunteers, mean (SD) age 34.7 (8.5) years each completed three tests. The first test was to perform Valsalva manoeuvres breathing air. The second and third tests involved breathing a high CO₂ mix (5% CO₂/16% O(2)/79% N₂) for 1 h prior to switching to breathe O₂ and performing Valsalva manoeuvres, or switching to breathe air for 1 min then O₂ and performing Valsalva manoeuvres. Blood pressure, cerebral blood flow velocity, electrocardiogram, and respiration were monitored throughout. A subjective questionnaire was administered at intervals to monitor symptom type and severity. RESULTS: Valsalva manoeuvres breathing air resulted in a 31% reduction in cerebral blood flow. Breathing high CO₂ caused a sustained increase in cerebral blood flow and symptoms of breathlessness and headache. Following the gas switch from high CO₂, some subjects reported faintness, headache and nausea. Cerebral blood flow dropped by 34% when switching from breathing high CO₂ to O₂, by 35% when switching to air then by a further 3% when switching from air to O₂. In both circumstances there was a further drop of 14% after performing the Valsalva manoeuvres. The drop in cerebral blood flow in subjects that reported faintness was greater than that in the subjects who did not, but this difference was not significant. CONCLUSION: Transient faintness or headache may occur in the escape tower during pressurisation, but this should be shortlived and not incapacitating. PMID: 25596831 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study investigated the combined effects of Valsalva manoeuvres and the 'CO₂-off' effect (rapid decrease in carbon dioxide partial pressure) on cerebral blood flow. Twenty male volunteers (mean age 34.7 years, SD 8.5 years) participated in three experimental conditions: performing Valsalva manoeuvres while breathing air; breathing a high CO₂ mix (5% CO₂/16% O₂/79% N₂) for 1 hour followed by a switch to O₂ and Valsalva; and breathing air for 1 minute then O₂ followed by Valsalva manoeuvres. Cerebral blood flow velocity, blood pressure, electrocardiogram, respiration, and subjective symptoms were monitored.

Breathing air during Valsalva resulted in a 31% reduction in cerebral blood flow. The high CO₂ breathing period induced sustained cerebral blood flow increases and symptoms of breathlessness and headache. Following the gas switch, cerebral blood flow decreased by 34% (switch to O₂) and 35% (switch to air then O₂). Performing Valsalva following these switches resulted in further reductions of 3% and 14% respectively. Subjects reporting faintness experienced a greater drop in cerebral blood flow compared to those who did not, although this difference lacked statistical significance. The study concluded that transient faintness or headache are possible during pressurisation but unlikely to be incapacitating. A limitation is the lack of blinding, as participants were aware of the experimental conditions.

 Statement Text: Stopping breathing after exhalation for one and a half minutes increases blood flow to the brain and heart fivefold. 
 Evidence Summary: This review article by Ono and Menezes Falcão (2025) summarizes the pathophysiology and treatment approaches for primary heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The authors conducted a literature review to characterize patients with primary HFpEF, who are typically elderly, more often female, and frequently have comorbidities including arterial hypertension, obesity, iron deficiency, coronary artery disease, sleep apnea, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and chronotropic incompetence. The review details the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with each comorbidity, highlighting how arterial hypertension promotes left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis, obesity contributes through systemic inflammation, aging causes ventricular-vascular stiffening, iron deficiency affects mitochondrial function, and so on. The authors conclude that understanding these complex, interrelated mechanisms is crucial for personalized management strategies in HFpEF. This review does not present original data; it synthesizes existing literature. A limitation is the absence of quantitative data or meta-analysis of clinical outcomes.

 Evidence Summary: This StatPearls article by Taghavi, Nassar, and Askari (2025) describes hypovolemia and hypovolemic shock. It is a review article intended to provide a general overview of the condition, rather than reporting results of original research. The article details the pathophysiology of hypovolemic shock, which arises from a significant reduction in blood volume leading to inadequate tissue perfusion. Common causes are listed as trauma, childbirth complications, internal bleeding, and severe dehydration. Typical patient presentations include rapid heart rate, shallow breathing, weakness, confusion, decreased urine output, low blood pressure, and clammy skin. Treatment strategies discussed involve intravenous fluid resuscitation, blood transfusions, medications to support blood pressure and cardiac output, and potential surgical intervention. Diagnosis relies on physical examination (vital signs, skin assessment, mental status) alongside laboratory tests (urinary sodium, serum lactate, complete blood count, chemistry panels, coagulation studies). The authors note that prompt and effective treatment is crucial to improve survival and mitigate the risk of organ failure and death associated with prolonged or severe hypovolemic shock. No original data or effect sizes are presented. The article's limitations are inherent to its nature as a review; it does not present findings from a specific study population.

 Statement Text: Stopping breathing after exhalation for one and a half minutes increases blood flow to the brain and heart fivefold. 
 Evidence Summary: This study investigated the temporal relationship between pulmonary oxygen uptake and cardiovascular responses during apnea in humans. Two groups of 18 participants each performed apneas (A) and apneas with cold-water face immersion (AFI) of increasing durations (15-120 seconds) in a randomized order. The primary outcome was the time course of pulmonary oxygen uptake, compared to cardiovascular responses (heart rate and cardiac output). Results showed that pulmonary oxygen uptake initially increased briefly from baseline during the first 15 seconds of both A and AFI, then gradually decreased during apnea, reaching sub-eupneic levels from 30 seconds onwards. This pattern mirrored the time course of heart rate and cardiac output. Cold-water face immersion augmented these changes. The authors conclude that preservation of the central pulmonary oxygen store is linked to cardiovascular responses such as reduced cardiac output and peripheral blood flow, which likely contribute to peripheral oxygen depletion. A limitation is the randomized order of apnea durations, which may have introduced bias.

 Evidence Summary: This study investigated the physiological effects of high-dose fentanyl in a rat model of overdose. Twenty-seven unsedated rats received an intravenous bolus injection of 150 µg/kg fentanyl. The study assessed ventilation, gas exchange, hemodynamics (including cardiac function), acid-base status, and arterial blood gas values. Following injection, rats immediately entered a comatose state with central apnea, followed by a depressed breathing pattern after approximately 2.5 minutes. A significant and immediate decrease in cardiac output (Q̇c) was observed (from 295.7 ± 42.62 to 140.74 ± 74.96 mL/kg/min; P < 0.0001), attributable to bradycardia (from 333.3 ± 20.8 to 112.2 ± 36.4 beats/min; P < 0.05) and transiently reduced cardiac contractility. This resulted in a substantial decrease in oxygen delivery (Do2) which was more severe than the decrease in oxygen consumption (V̇o2). Severe hypoxemia persisted throughout the period of hypoventilation. Three rats experienced pulseless electrical activity arrest. Twenty-four rats survived. The study suggests that cardiac and circulatory effects, particularly bradycardia-induced reduction in cardiac output, are major contributors to fentanyl overdose lethality in conjunction with apnea and hypoxemia.

 Evidence Summary: This study investigated the respiratory effects of common infant product materials on healthy adults. Nine young adult participants completed ten-minute prone trials breathing into five materials: 100% cotton, 50/50 cotton/polyester, 10/90 spandex/polyester, and 100% polyester. Baseline trials with unobstructed breathing were also performed for comparison. Respiratory rate, end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2), heart rate, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) were measured. 

Results showed that 100% cotton and 50/50 cotton/polyester materials significantly altered EtCO2 and SpO2 levels. The 10/90 spandex/polyester material significantly impacted SpO2 alone. All materials caused significant decreases in respiratory rate and increases in heart rate compared to baseline. The 100% polyester material did not result in significant changes. The authors suggest that even short-term exposure to some materials may pose a risk to infants, particularly those with less robust respiratory responses. The study’s limitation is that the findings were based on adult participants and may not directly reflect infant physiology.

 Evidence Summary: This retrospective study investigated characteristics and outcomes in cancer patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) at the King Hussein Cancer Center in Jordan between January 2021 and August 2022. Researchers analyzed data from 632 adult cancer patients meeting criteria for CAP, following Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Data collected included patient demographics, microbiological cultures (blood and sputum), length of hospital stay, ICU transfers, and all-cause mortality. Early clinical stability was defined by specific temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation values on day three of admission. The mean age of participants was 60 years (SD 13.9), and 55.2% were male. Positive blood and sputum cultures were found in 12.4% and 30.0% of patients, respectively. Approximately 48.9% achieved early clinical stability, with a median hospital stay of 6 days (range 1-48) for this subgroup. ICU transfer occurred in 3.2% of patients, and mortality was observed in 10.9%. The authors concluded that further research is needed to identify interventions to improve outcomes for this patient population. A limitation of the study is its retrospective design.

 Evidence Summary: This study investigated the effects of ambrisentan exposure in juvenile rats to support clinical studies in children under 8 years old. Rats (postnatal days 7-62) were administered ambrisentan at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. Respiratory function was assessed via ventilatory parameters and arterial blood gases. The primary finding was a statistically significant decrease in brain weight (4%, p < 0.05) at the highest dose, without observed histological changes. Concurrent observations included noisy breathing (described as clicking noises), apneic episodes, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia, suggestive of intermittent airway obstruction. The authors propose a link between the brain weight reduction and sustained hypoxemia during a period of rapid brain growth. A limitation is the use of a single rat model, which may not fully translate to human physiology. The clinical relevance of these findings is currently unknown, although the authors suggest a potential window of risk based on the timing of palatal/laryngeal maturation, potentially extending to age 3 in children with PAH or developmental delay.

 Evidence Summary: This retrospective study characterized the hemodynamic profile of supine syncope triggered by needle insertion. Researchers analyzed data from 4876 patients with orthostatic intolerance who underwent autonomic testing at Brigham and Women’s Faulkner Hospital between 2016 and 2024. Five patients (0.1%) experienced syncope following needle insertion for skin biopsy (using 0.5 mL of 1% lidocaine for anesthesia). Continuous monitoring included transcranial Doppler (cerebral blood flow velocity), end-tidal CO2, ECG, and beat-to-beat blood pressure. Syncope occurred with a latency of 56 seconds, preceded by symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion. Affected patients exhibited progressive decreases in heart rate, blood pressure, and cerebral blood flow velocity, along with hyperventilation and widening of the transcranial Doppler signal. Syncope types included cardioinhibition without asystole (one patient) and cardioinhibition with asystole (two patients). The study concludes that needle insertion-induced syncope is associated with cardioinhibitory, vasodepressor, and cerebral arteriolar vasodilatory responses. A limitation is the retrospective design and the small sample size of affected patients.

Twelve physically active volunteers (12 total, 3 women, peak oxygen uptake 49 ± 5 mL·kg-1·min-1) participated in a randomized, single-blind, crossover trial with three experimental conditions: 0%, 2%, and 4% inspired CO2. Participants completed a 10-minute walk followed by a self-paced 2-mile treadmill run under each condition. 

Run performance was significantly slower in the 2% (5 ± 3% slower) and 4% (7 ± 3% slower) CO2 trials compared to the 0% CO2 control (both p < 0.001). The 4% CO2 trial resulted in a significantly slower run time compared to the 2% CO2 trial (p = 0.046). Ventilation increased with increasing CO2 levels. Dyspnea and headache were also significantly elevated in the 4% CO2 trial compared to the 0% and 2% trials. One participant did not complete the 4% CO2 trial due to lightheadedness. The study concludes that increasing inspired CO2 impairs endurance performance in a stepwise manner.

 Statement Text: Decreasing carbon dioxide levels through breathing exercises causes dizziness. 
 Evidence Summary: This article presents a hypothesis regarding the etiology of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The authors propose that BPPV arises from the fragility of otoliths (inner ear structures composed of calcium carbonate) which are susceptible to dissolution at lower pH levels. The hypothesis is grounded in evolutionary biology, noting that while vertebrate bones transitioned to calcium phosphate for increased strength, otoliths retained the ancestral calcium carbonate composition due to their lack of muscular connection. The authors theorize that shallow breathing during sleep, leading to mild respiratory acidosis and decreased blood pH, may contribute to otolith detachment and subsequent BPPV, particularly in the morning. Furthermore, conditions such as diabetes mellitus and gout, which are associated with lower blood pH, are suggested to increase the risk of BPPV. This is a theoretical paper proposing a hypothesis, and does not report data from original research or clinical trials. It does not describe a study population or specific outcome measures. The authors acknowledge the evolutionary basis of their proposition, but do not present empirical evidence to directly test their hypothesis.

 Statement Text: Decreasing carbon dioxide levels through breathing exercises causes dizziness. 
 Evidence Summary: This study investigated the combined effects of Valsalva manoeuvres and the 'CO₂-off' effect (rapid decrease in carbon dioxide partial pressure) on cerebral blood flow. Twenty male volunteers (mean age 34.7 years, SD 8.5 years) participated in three experimental conditions: performing Valsalva manoeuvres while breathing air; breathing a high CO₂ mix (5% CO₂/16% O₂/79% N₂) for 1 hour followed by a switch to O₂ and Valsalva; and breathing air for 1 minute then O₂ followed by Valsalva manoeuvres. Cerebral blood flow velocity, blood pressure, electrocardiogram, respiration, and subjective symptoms were monitored.

Breathing air during Valsalva resulted in a 31% reduction in cerebral blood flow. The high CO₂ breathing period induced sustained cerebral blood flow increases and symptoms of breathlessness and headache. Following the gas switch, cerebral blood flow decreased by 34% (switch to O₂) and 35% (switch to air then O₂). Performing Valsalva following these switches resulted in further reductions of 3% and 14% respectively. Subjects reporting faintness experienced a greater drop in cerebral blood flow compared to those who did not, although this difference lacked statistical significance. The study concluded that transient faintness or headache are possible during pressurisation but unlikely to be incapacitating. A limitation is the lack of blinding, as participants were aware of the experimental conditions. 
 Response: yes

Evidence: This study investigated the respiratory effects of common infant product materials on healthy adults. Nine young adult participants completed ten-minute prone trials breathing into five materials: 100% cotton, 50/50 cotton/polyester, 10/90 spandex/polyester, and 100% polyester. Baseline trials with unobstructed breathing were also performed for comparison. Respiratory rate, end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2), heart rate, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) were measured.   Results showed that 100% cotton and 50/50 cotton/polyester materials significantly altered EtCO2 and SpO2 levels. The 10/90 spandex/polyester material significantly impacted SpO2 alone. All materials caused significant decreases in respiratory rate and increases in heart rate compared to baseline. The 100% polyester material did not result in significant changes. The authors suggest that even short-term exposure to some materials may pose a risk to infants, particularly those with less robust respiratory responses. The study’s limitation is that the findings were based on adult participants and may not directly reflect infant physiology.
