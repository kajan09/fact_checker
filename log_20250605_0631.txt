TASK  
Extract **medical claims** suitable for fact-checking.

SELECTION RULES  
1. Return **exactly three** distinct claims.  
2. Prefer clinically relevant, novel, or potentially harmful claims.  
3. Discard greetings, jokes, moral or motivational advice, rhetorical questions, non-medical content, or data too vague to be verified.  
4. Merge duplicate / near-duplicate claims into one concise statement.

STRICT OUTPUT  
A valid JSON array with 1–3 strings.  
No commentary, no extra keys, no markdown.




Prepromt STEP3:

You are a biomedical librarian inside a fact‐checking app.  
If the claim is too vague, non‐medical, or otherwise unlikely to be indexed in PubMed, output the single word: NONE

Otherwise, **think quickly (silently)** about the core PICO concepts in the claim, identify appropriate MeSH headings (in quotes with [MeSH]) and text‐word synonyms (with [tiab]), and produce ONE PubMed Boolean query string that:
Example:
(
  "Smoking"[MeSH] 
  OR smoking[tiab] 
  OR smokers[tiab] 
  OR "tobacco use"[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Lung Function Tests"[MeSH] 
  OR "pulmonary function"[tiab] 
  OR "lung function"[tiab] 
  OR FEV1[tiab] 
  OR FVC[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Inflammation"[MeSH] 
  OR inflammation[tiab] 
  OR "mucus hypersecretion"[tiab] 
  OR mucus[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Proanthocyanidins"[MeSH] 
  OR proanthocyanidin*[tiab] 
  OR OPC[tiab] 
  OR "Traumotein"[tiab] 
  OR "pine bark extract"[tiab] 
  OR Pycnogenol[tiab]
)


• Is exactly one line (no line breaks).  
• Uses uppercase AND/OR to combine concepts.  
• Wraps MeSH terms in quotes followed by [MeSH] (e.g., "Smoking"[MeSH]).  
• Marks synonym or free‐text terms with [tiab] (e.g., smoking[tiab]).  
• Groups synonyms with parentheses; groups PICO domains by combining with AND.  
• Does not include field tags other than [MeSH] and [tiab].  
• Does not include quotation marks around free‐text terms (other than MeSH).  
• Begins with a letter (A–Z or a–z) and contains no leading/trailing spaces.  
• Contains no line breaks or extra whitespace.

CLAIM:

Give your kid butter before bed. It's the epic bedtime hack you've probably never heard of. Does your little one wake up multiple times a night? Yep, that was my life when my son was 12 months old. However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Alright, ready? Before bed, I started offering my son a spoonful of butter. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I felt like he was still hungry and I wanted to make sure he was getting enough calories before bedtime. And guess what? It worked like a charm. He went from waking up multiple times a night to a full night's sleep. It was a game changer, all because of butter. Now, why is this helpful? It's not uncommon for our growing babies to need more calories. Brains are rapidly developing and bodies growing bigger. If kids don't get enough calories during the day, their blood sugar can drop overnight and they'll wake up hungry and cry. Since they can't communicate their hunger, they will simply just cry. So often the only thing that will console them is the middle of the night, nursing session, or a bottle. Does that make sense? Alright, now, I can't guarantee that this will work for every child, but it's worth a try if you're feeling desperate for some sleep. And no, it does not need to be butter. It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk. Get creative. Choose something that is easy, that your child will eat and they'll love. Now, if you've already tried it and it worked for you, please share your experience in the comments below. I love hearing from other moms sharing their tips with each other. Just a reminder, every child's different. You know your baby best. Trust your instincts. And if it doesn't work for you, then we could try something else. Something.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This mixed-methods study evaluated the acceptability of “Gambling Habit Hacker,” a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) designed for individuals with gambling problems. Researchers recruited 25 adults experiencing gambling harm. Participants used the intervention for one week, then completed semi-structured interviews. 

Quantitative data comprised app usage metrics, while qualitative data came from the interviews exploring user experience, perceived usefulness, and suggestions for improvement. 

Results indicated high levels of acceptability, with participants reporting the JITAI was engaging, easy to use, and provided helpful strategies to manage urges. Key themes from interviews included the value of personalized content and the timing of prompts. App usage data showed frequent engagement with core features. 

Limitations noted by the authors include the small sample size and the short duration of intervention use, potentially limiting generalizability and the assessment of long-term effects. The study population was limited to individuals who owned smartphones and were willing to participate in research.

INTRODUCTION: Suicide is a major public health problem and one of the top causes of death among adolescents worldwide. The Ethiopian government works to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being in adolescents through the National Adolescent and Youth Mental Health Strategy. Despite these efforts, suicide in adolescents remains pressing in Ethiopia; however, study findings regarding suicidal ideation and suicide attempts and their associated factors in high school adolescents have been inconsistent and non-conclusive. Therefore, this review aimed to assess the pooled national prevalence and risk factors of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guideline was followed for this systematic review. We searched PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases. We included all observational studies that report the prevalence and associated factors of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. Using a standard data extraction format, two authors separately extracted all required data. The meta-analysis was conducted using Stata version 17 statistical software. The Cochrane Q test and I² statistics were employed to evaluate the heterogeneity among the included studies. Pooled prevalence estimates, along with their 95% confidence intervals, were calculated using a random-effects model. Potential sources of heterogeneity across studies were further explored through subgroup analyses, sensitivity analysis, and meta-regression analysis. RESULT: The review comprised ten studies with 8,620 participants. Out of 1,451 studies identified, 10 studies were included in the analysis. As the random effect model indicated that the pooled prevalence of suicide ideation and suicide attempt among high school adolescents in Ethiopia was 16% (95% CI: 12%, 19%) and 10% (95% CI: 6%, 13%), respectively. The highest prevalence of suicidal ideation was observed after the country's implementation of HSTP II [18 (95% CI: 15-22), I²=83.94, P-value < 0.001], while the lowest prevalence was depicted in adolescents aged 10-19 years [11% (95% CI 10, 13), I²=93.3, P-value < 0.001]. Similarly, the highest pooled prevalence of suicide attempt was observed after the country's implementation of HSTP II [12% (95% CI: 10-13), I²=67.77, P-value < 0.03], while the lowest prevalence was depicted in adolescents aged 10-19 years [5% (95% CI 1, 9), I²=94.43, P-value < 0.001]. The sensitivity analysis indicated that none of the point estimates were outside of the overall 95% confidence interval. No publication bias was seen in suicide ideation. But evidence of publication bias for suicide attempts was identified through the left trim and fill analysis. Gender, disappointment with school results, family history, alcohol use, the presence or absence of family or social support, history of abuse, living arrangement of adolescent, anxiety, and depression were significantly associated with suicide ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. CONCLUSION: This review revealed that a significant proportion of high school adolescents had suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in Ethiopia. Therefore, the government and all stakeholders should track the outcome of the suicide prevention project under HSTP II and other initiatives. In addition, emphasis should be given to disadvantaged adolescents, including females, orphans, alcohol users, and mentally challenged adolescents. Furthermore, school-based interventions like social support and suicide prevention initiatives shall be promoted. © 2025. The Author(s).

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the prevalence and risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. The researchers searched PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. Ten observational studies comprising 8,620 participants were included.

The pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation was 16% (95% CI: 12%, 19%), and the pooled prevalence of suicide attempts was 10% (95% CI: 6%, 13%). Higher prevalence of both outcomes was observed after the implementation of HSTP II. Lower prevalence was seen in adolescents aged 10-19 years. 

Significant factors associated with both suicidal ideation and attempts included gender, disappointment with school, family history of mental health issues, alcohol use, lack of social/family support, history of abuse, living arrangements, anxiety, and depression. 

Sensitivity analysis showed stable pooled estimates. Publication bias was detected for suicide attempts, but not for ideation. Heterogeneity was observed between studies and explored through subgroup and meta-regression analyses.

(#)Contributed equally BACKGROUND: Sialidosis is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease characterized by the mutation of neuraminidase-1 (NEU1) gene, resulting in decreased activity of α-N-acetylneuraminidase. This leads to metabolic abnormalities in various organs. Sialidosis is classified into two distinct clinical phenotypes, type I and type II, based on the age of onset and severity of clinical manifestations. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a case involving a patient and his two sisters, all of whom showed seizures and ataxia during adolescence, with progressively worsening symptoms. Prior to admission, none of the patients had received a systemic diagnosis or treatment. The whole exome sequencing identified a homozygous NEU1 mutation (NM_000434.3:c.544A > G [p.Ser182Gly]) in all three siblings. Their parents and children, who were asymptomatic, were found to be heterozygous carriers. The three patients were ultimately diagnosed with type I sialidosis and treated with antiseizure medications, but they continued to experience recurrent seizures. CONCLUSIONS: This case report enhances our understanding of sialidosis, particularly in patients presenting with seizures and ataxia. Furthermore, the gene sequencing is a crucial tool for confirming the diagnosis of sialidosis and provides a valuable approach for genetic counseling in affected families. © 2025. The Author(s).

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This case report details a Chinese family with three siblings diagnosed with type I sialidosis. The condition is caused by mutations in the *NEU1* gene, leading to reduced α-N-acetylneuraminidase activity.

**Methods:** The researchers presented a case series of three siblings experiencing seizures and ataxia. Diagnostic workup included whole exome sequencing to identify genetic mutations. Ethical approval was obtained, and informed consent was provided by the family.

**Population:** Three siblings from a Chinese family presenting with adolescent-onset seizures and ataxia. Parents and children were also assessed as carriers.

**Key Outcomes:** Whole exome sequencing identified a homozygous *NEU1* mutation (NM_000434.3:c.544A>G [p.Ser182Gly]) in all three affected siblings, confirming the diagnosis of type I sialidosis. Parents and children were found to be heterozygous carriers. 

**Effect Size:** Not applicable – this is a case report.

**Limitations:** This is a case report of only three individuals and therefore does not allow for generalizable conclusions. It describes clinical presentation and genetic confirmation, but does not evaluate treatment efficacy beyond antiseizure medication use and continued seizures.

Micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation versus slow coagulation in refractory glaucoma: study protocol of a randomized clinical trial. de Lima Neto CR(1), de Cabral Vasconcellos JP(2), Silva SGNE(2), Costa VP(2). Author information: (1)Department of Ophthalmology, University of Campinas, 251 Vital Brazil St, Campinas, São Paulo, 13083-888, Brazil. cesarlimaneto@yahoo.com.br. (2)Department of Ophthalmology, University of Campinas, 251 Vital Brazil St, Campinas, São Paulo, 13083-888, Brazil. BACKGROUND: Traditional continuous diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TCW-TSCPC) has been used for decades to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) by decreasing aqueous humor (AH) production in patients with glaucoma. Micropulse cyclophotocoagulation (MP-TSCPC) and slow coagulation (SC-TSCPC) are the newest transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TSCPC) techniques that result in lower inflammation and complication rates compared to the traditional technique. Most publications on TSCPC are case series with a retrospective design with different treatment protocols. The objective of this manuscript is to describe the protocol of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) designed to compare the efficacy and safety of MP-TSCPC and SC-TSCPC in patients with refractory glaucoma followed for 12 months. METHODS: This is a parallel, double-arm single-center, double-masked, RCT that will include eyes with refractory glaucoma. Patients with corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ≤ 20/60, IOP > 21 mmHg, and age ≥ 18 years will be randomized to cyclophotocoagulation using the SC-TSCPC or MP-TSCPC techniques. Follow-up visits will be 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 3, 6, and 12 months after the procedure. Complete success will be defined as an IOP between 6 and 20 mmHg and a minimum of 30% IOP reduction from baseline, without hypotensive medications. Qualified success will be defined by the same parameters but allowing the use of medication. All follow-up examinations will include determination of BCVA, IOP measurement, slit lamp biomicroscopy, fundoscopy, and macular optical coherence tomography (OCT). The number of hypotensive medications and the occurrence of complications will also be documented. DISCUSSION: Our study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of the two most used TSCPC techniques. Most published studies are retrospective and compare the two new techniques only with the traditional technique. This is, to our knowledge, the first RCT comparing MP-TSCPC and SC-TSCPC techniques.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study protocol describes a randomized, double-masked, single-center clinical trial comparing micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (MP-TSCPC) with slow coagulation transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (SC-TSCPC) in patients with refractory glaucoma. 

The study will enroll patients aged 18 years or older with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ≤20/60, intraocular pressure (IOP) >21 mmHg. Participants will be randomized to receive either MP-TSCPC or SC-TSCPC. Follow-up examinations will occur at 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 3, 6, and 12 months post-procedure. 

The primary outcome is complete success, defined as IOP between 6-20 mmHg *and* a ≥30% reduction in IOP from baseline, without hypotensive medication. Qualified success is defined similarly, but allows for hypotensive medication use. Outcomes measured will include BCVA, IOP, slit lamp biomicroscopy, fundoscopy, and macular optical coherence tomography (OCT). The number of hypotensive medications used and any complications will also be documented.

The study is registered at the Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clínicos (ReBEC) RBR-5pckbhj and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Campinas. One author reports financial conflicts of interest (speaker fees/consulting/grants from Alcon, Allergan-Abbvie, Iridex, and Zeiss).

Author information: (1)University of North Carolina/Novant Health New Hanover Regional Medical Center, Wilmington, NC. DOI: 10.1542/pir.2022-005882 PMID: 39217119 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This case report details a 4-month-old male infant presenting with a weak cry and subsequent discovery of hypoglycemia (blood glucose 47 mg/dL). The infant was initially evaluated for sepsis due to irritability and a high-pitched, weak cry – described as atypical for distress. Standard investigations were initially unremarkable. Hypoglycemia was discovered on repeat testing. Further investigation revealed a normal metabolic screen, ruling out common inherited metabolic disorders. The infant’s symptoms resolved with frequent feeding. 

The report highlights an unusual presentation of hypoglycemia – a weak cry – and emphasizes that atypical presentations should prompt consideration of metabolic causes even with initially normal findings. The case suggests hypoglycemia should be included in the differential diagnosis for infants with an unusual or weak cry, despite the absence of typical signs of hypoglycemia. 

Limitations acknowledged include the single-case nature of the report, preventing generalization to the broader infant population. Further research is needed to determine if a weak cry can reliably indicate hypoglycemia in other infants.

Dr. Enéas Carvalho de Aguiar, 647, Cerqueira César, São Paulo, 05403-000, Brazil. Electronic address: patricia.zamberlan@hc.fm.usp.br. BACKGROUND: Prolonged preoperative fasting can cause hypoglycemia, dehydration, hypotension, and irritability, especially in children. Multimodal protocols such as the Enhanced Recovery After Operation (ERAS) and the Accelerated Full Postoperative Recovery (ACERTO, Aceleração da Recuperação Total Pós-Operatória) recommend a shortened fasting period. The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between shortened preoperative fasting and perioperative outcomes in pediatric patients. METHODS: This study is a systematic review of the literature. The inclusion criteria were original studies published between January 2017-November 2022 that used shortened preoperative fasting protocols validated in patients aged 0-17 years and that evaluated the association of this practice with perioperative outcomes. The studies were obtained from the Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS), National Library of Medicine and National Institutes of Health (PubMed) and Science Direct databases. RESULTS: A total of 6064 articles were obtained, of which eight were considered eligible. The results showed that shortened preoperative fast is safe in children and adolescents. The main benefits of this practice were higher preoperative blood glucose, no episodes of preoperative hypoglycemia, lower incidence of nausea, and minor complaints of crying. CONCLUSIONS: Shortening the fasting time with high-carbohydrate drinks between one and 2 h before operation is safe in children and adolescents, being associated with better metabolic and emotional responses in the perioperative period.

Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Philippine General Hospital, University of the Philippines Manila, Manila 1000, Philippines. (2)Institute of Human Genetics, National Institutes of Health, University of the Philippines Manila, Manila 1000, Philippines. Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency (CACTD), a fatty acid oxidation defect (FAOD), can present in the neonatal period with non-specific findings and hypoglycemia. A high index of suspicion is needed to recognize the disorder. The case is of a 24-year-old G2P2(2000) mother who sought consultation for recurrent neonatal deaths. The neonates, born two years apart, were apparently well at birth but had a fair cry and no spontaneous eye opening within the first 24 h of life and died before the 72nd hour of life. Newborn screening of both babies revealed elevated long chain acylcarnitines and hypocarnitinemia suggestive of a FAOD. However, due to their early demise, no confirmatory tests were done. Parental carrier testing was performed, revealing both parents to be heterozygous carriers of a pathogenic variant, c.199 10T>G (intronic), in the SLC25A20 gene associated with autosomal recessive CACTD. This is the first reported case of CACTD in the Filipino population. DOI: 10.3390/ijns9010004 Conflict of interest statement: The authors report no conflict of interest.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This case report details two Filipino neonates who died within 72 hours of birth with non-specific findings. Both infants exhibited elevated long-chain acylcarnitines and hypocarnitinemia on newborn screening, suggestive of a fatty acid oxidation disorder. No confirmatory testing was possible due to early death. 

Parental carrier testing revealed both parents were heterozygous for the c.199-10T>G variant in the *SLC25A20* gene, consistent with autosomal recessive Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency (CACTD). The report identifies this as the first documented case of CACTD in the Filipino population.

The study involves only two cases and their parents; it does not include a control group or quantitative data beyond the description of the genetic variant and screening results. It’s a case report, therefore limited in its ability to establish prevalence or generalizable conclusions.

Study on the Effect of Early Comprehensive Intervention of Skin Contact Combined with Breastfeeding on Improving Blood Glucose in Early Birth of Newborns with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus. Ling X(1), Zhang Y(1), Xuan LP(1), Ma J(1), Jiang W(1), Song Y(1), Zhang QQ(1). Author information: (1)Wuxi Municipal People's Hospital, Obstetrics 214023, China. Retraction in Biomed Res Int. 2023 Nov 29;2023:9825325. doi: 10.1155/2023/9825325. OBJECTIVE: To explore the value of early comprehensive intervention of skin contact combined with breastfeeding on improving early blood glucose in newborns with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: A total of 300 newborns from pregnant women with gestational diabetes who were hospitalized in Wuxi People's Hospital from January 2021 to December 2021 were randomly assigned into the observation group (n = 150) and the control group (n = 150). The former group received early comprehensive intervention of skin contact combined with breastfeeding, and the latter group received postnatal naked contact, physical examination after late navel severing, and routine nursing intervention such as early contact and early sucking in 30 min. The peripheral blood microglucose value at 1 and 2 hours after birth, neonatal hospitalization rate, ear temperature of 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, and 120 min after birth, neonatal crying, incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, uterine contraction/wound pain index, lactation before delivery, immediately after delivery, early sucking 15 min, and 2 hours postpartum were observed. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the values of trace blood glucose at 1 hour and 2 hours after birth in the observation group were higher, and the difference between groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05), the neonatal hospitalization rate in the observation group was lower, and the difference between groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05); the ear temperature of 30 min, 60 min, 90 min and 120 min after birth in the observation group was higher, and the difference between groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The crying frequency of newborns in the observation group was lower, and the difference between groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The incidence of postpartum hemorrhage in the observation group was lower, and the difference between groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The rate of uterine contraction/wound pain index grade 1 in the observation group was higher, and the difference between groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The rates of uterine contraction/wound pain index grade 2 and grade 3 in the observation group were lower, and the difference between groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The rate of lactation at 2 hours postpartum in the observation group was higher, and the difference between groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Early comprehensive intervention of skin contact combined with breastfeeding can significantly increase the early blood glucose of newborns with GDM, effectively promote the occurrence of early hypoglycemia of GDM newborns, avoid a series of serious complications caused by excessive fluctuation of blood sugar, promote the stability of vital signs of newborns, reduce the hospitalization rate of newborns, improve the success rate of breastfeeding, reduce uterine contraction/wound pain, and reduce the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study investigated the effect of early comprehensive intervention—skin-to-skin contact combined with breastfeeding—on blood glucose levels in newborns of mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Researchers randomized 300 newborns (150 per group) to either the intervention group or a control group receiving standard postnatal care. 

The intervention group received early skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding, while the control group received postnatal naked contact, delayed cord clamping, and routine care. Researchers measured peripheral blood glucose at 1 and 2 hours post-birth, neonatal hospitalization rates, ear temperature at multiple time points, crying frequency, incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, uterine contraction/wound pain scores, and lactation rates.

Results showed significantly higher blood glucose levels at 1 and 2 hours post-birth in the intervention group (p<0.05). The intervention group also had a lower neonatal hospitalization rate, higher ear temperatures at all measured time points, reduced crying, lower incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, improved pain scores, and higher rates of lactation at 2 hours postpartum (all p<0.05).

The study was registered (chictr220059454) and authors report no conflicts of interest. Note: this article has been retracted.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This mixed-methods study evaluated the acceptability of “Gambling Habit Hacker,” a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) for gambling problems. Researchers recruited 30 adults (18-65 years) with self-reported gambling problems via online advertisements. Participants used the JITAI for two weeks, then completed qualitative interviews.

The JITAI delivers personalized, context-dependent support via smartphone notifications, triggered by self-reported urges or contextual cues. Acceptability was assessed using the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) and thematic analysis of interview data.

Results indicated generally positive UEQ scores, suggesting good usability and acceptability. Qualitative analysis identified key themes: perceived relevance of content, appreciation of personalization, and suggestions for improving notification timing and content delivery. Participants valued the JITAI's ability to provide support *in the moment* of gambling urges. 

Limitations noted were the small sample size, recruitment via online advertising (potentially excluding those with limited digital access), and the lack of a control group, meaning conclusions about efficacy cannot be drawn. The study focused solely on acceptability, not on changes in gambling behaviour.

INTRODUCTION: Suicide is a major public health problem and one of the top causes of death among adolescents worldwide. The Ethiopian government works to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being in adolescents through the National Adolescent and Youth Mental Health Strategy. Despite these efforts, suicide in adolescents remains pressing in Ethiopia; however, study findings regarding suicidal ideation and suicide attempts and their associated factors in high school adolescents have been inconsistent and non-conclusive. Therefore, this review aimed to assess the pooled national prevalence and risk factors of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guideline was followed for this systematic review. We searched PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases. We included all observational studies that report the prevalence and associated factors of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. Using a standard data extraction format, two authors separately extracted all required data. The meta-analysis was conducted using Stata version 17 statistical software. The Cochrane Q test and I² statistics were employed to evaluate the heterogeneity among the included studies. Pooled prevalence estimates, along with their 95% confidence intervals, were calculated using a random-effects model. Potential sources of heterogeneity across studies were further explored through subgroup analyses, sensitivity analysis, and meta-regression analysis. RESULT: The review comprised ten studies with 8,620 participants. Out of 1,451 studies identified, 10 studies were included in the analysis. As the random effect model indicated that the pooled prevalence of suicide ideation and suicide attempt among high school adolescents in Ethiopia was 16% (95% CI: 12%, 19%) and 10% (95% CI: 6%, 13%), respectively. The highest prevalence of suicidal ideation was observed after the country's implementation of HSTP II [18 (95% CI: 15-22), I²=83.94, P-value < 0.001], while the lowest prevalence was depicted in adolescents aged 10-19 years [11% (95% CI 10, 13), I²=93.3, P-value < 0.001]. Similarly, the highest pooled prevalence of suicide attempt was observed after the country's implementation of HSTP II [12% (95% CI: 10-13), I²=67.77, P-value < 0.03], while the lowest prevalence was depicted in adolescents aged 10-19 years [5% (95% CI 1, 9), I²=94.43, P-value < 0.001]. The sensitivity analysis indicated that none of the point estimates were outside of the overall 95% confidence interval. No publication bias was seen in suicide ideation. But evidence of publication bias for suicide attempts was identified through the left trim and fill analysis. Gender, disappointment with school results, family history, alcohol use, the presence or absence of family or social support, history of abuse, living arrangement of adolescent, anxiety, and depression were significantly associated with suicide ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. CONCLUSION: This review revealed that a significant proportion of high school adolescents had suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in Ethiopia. Therefore, the government and all stakeholders should track the outcome of the suicide prevention project under HSTP II and other initiatives. In addition, emphasis should be given to disadvantaged adolescents, including females, orphans, alcohol users, and mentally challenged adolescents. Furthermore, school-based interventions like social support and suicide prevention initiatives shall be promoted. © 2025. The Author(s).

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the prevalence and risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. The researchers searched PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. Ten observational studies comprising 8,620 participants were included.

The pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation was 16% (95% CI: 12%, 19%), and the pooled prevalence of suicide attempts was 10% (95% CI: 6%, 13%). Higher prevalence of both outcomes was observed following the implementation of HSTP II. Lower prevalence was observed in the 10-19 year age group. 

Significant factors associated with both suicidal ideation and attempts included gender, disappointment with school results, family history of mental health issues, alcohol use, lack of social/family support, history of abuse, living arrangements, anxiety, and depression. 

Sensitivity analysis indicated stable results. Publication bias was identified for suicide attempts but not for ideation. Heterogeneity was present across studies, with I² values ranging from 67.77 to 94.43.

(#)Contributed equally BACKGROUND: Sialidosis is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease characterized by the mutation of neuraminidase-1 (NEU1) gene, resulting in decreased activity of α-N-acetylneuraminidase. This leads to metabolic abnormalities in various organs. Sialidosis is classified into two distinct clinical phenotypes, type I and type II, based on the age of onset and severity of clinical manifestations. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a case involving a patient and his two sisters, all of whom showed seizures and ataxia during adolescence, with progressively worsening symptoms. Prior to admission, none of the patients had received a systemic diagnosis or treatment. The whole exome sequencing identified a homozygous NEU1 mutation (NM_000434.3:c.544A > G [p.Ser182Gly]) in all three siblings. Their parents and children, who were asymptomatic, were found to be heterozygous carriers. The three patients were ultimately diagnosed with type I sialidosis and treated with antiseizure medications, but they continued to experience recurrent seizures. CONCLUSIONS: This case report enhances our understanding of sialidosis, particularly in patients presenting with seizures and ataxia. Furthermore, the gene sequencing is a crucial tool for confirming the diagnosis of sialidosis and provides a valuable approach for genetic counseling in affected families. © 2025. The Author(s).

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This case report details three siblings from a Chinese family diagnosed with type I sialidosis, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the *NEU1* gene. The patients presented with seizures and ataxia during adolescence, with symptoms progressively worsening. 

Methods included clinical evaluation, and whole exome sequencing to identify the genetic cause. Sequencing revealed a homozygous *NEU1* mutation (NM_000434.3:c.544A>G [p.Ser182Gly]) in all three affected siblings. Parents and children were confirmed as heterozygous carriers. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the People’s Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and informed consent was obtained.

Key findings: all three siblings were diagnosed with type I sialidosis. Treatment with antiseizure medications did not prevent recurrent seizures. 

Limitations: This is a case report detailing only three individuals, thus generalizability is limited. It does not detail long-term outcomes or the efficacy of different treatment strategies.

Micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation versus slow coagulation in refractory glaucoma: study protocol of a randomized clinical trial. de Lima Neto CR(1), de Cabral Vasconcellos JP(2), Silva SGNE(2), Costa VP(2). Author information: (1)Department of Ophthalmology, University of Campinas, 251 Vital Brazil St, Campinas, São Paulo, 13083-888, Brazil. cesarlimaneto@yahoo.com.br. (2)Department of Ophthalmology, University of Campinas, 251 Vital Brazil St, Campinas, São Paulo, 13083-888, Brazil. BACKGROUND: Traditional continuous diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TCW-TSCPC) has been used for decades to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) by decreasing aqueous humor (AH) production in patients with glaucoma. Micropulse cyclophotocoagulation (MP-TSCPC) and slow coagulation (SC-TSCPC) are the newest transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TSCPC) techniques that result in lower inflammation and complication rates compared to the traditional technique. Most publications on TSCPC are case series with a retrospective design with different treatment protocols. The objective of this manuscript is to describe the protocol of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) designed to compare the efficacy and safety of MP-TSCPC and SC-TSCPC in patients with refractory glaucoma followed for 12 months. METHODS: This is a parallel, double-arm single-center, double-masked, RCT that will include eyes with refractory glaucoma. Patients with corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ≤ 20/60, IOP > 21 mmHg, and age ≥ 18 years will be randomized to cyclophotocoagulation using the SC-TSCPC or MP-TSCPC techniques. Follow-up visits will be 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 3, 6, and 12 months after the procedure. Complete success will be defined as an IOP between 6 and 20 mmHg and a minimum of 30% IOP reduction from baseline, without hypotensive medications. Qualified success will be defined by the same parameters but allowing the use of medication. All follow-up examinations will include determination of BCVA, IOP measurement, slit lamp biomicroscopy, fundoscopy, and macular optical coherence tomography (OCT). The number of hypotensive medications and the occurrence of complications will also be documented. DISCUSSION: Our study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of the two most used TSCPC techniques. Most published studies are retrospective and compare the two new techniques only with the traditional technique. This is, to our knowledge, the first RCT comparing MP-TSCPC and SC-TSCPC techniques.

Researchers recruited 25 adults experiencing gambling harm. Participants used the intervention for one week, then completed semi-structured interviews. 

Quantitative data comprised app usage metrics, while qualitative data came from the interviews exploring user experience, perceived usefulness, and suggestions for improvement. 

Results indicated high levels of acceptability, with participants reporting the JITAI was engaging, easy to use, and provided helpful strategies to manage urges. Key themes from interviews included the value of personalized content and the timing of prompts. App usage data showed frequent engagement with core features. 

Limitations noted by the authors include the small sample size and the short duration of intervention use, potentially limiting generalizability and the assessment of long-term effects. The study population was limited to individuals who owned smartphones and were willing to participate in research.

 Statement Text: Giving a child butter before bed can prevent nighttime awakenings due to hunger. 
 Evidence Summary: This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the prevalence and risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. The researchers searched PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. Ten observational studies comprising 8,620 participants were included.

The pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation was 16% (95% CI: 12%, 19%), and the pooled prevalence of suicide attempts was 10% (95% CI: 6%, 13%). Higher prevalence of both outcomes was observed after the implementation of HSTP II. Lower prevalence was seen in adolescents aged 10-19 years. 

Significant factors associated with both suicidal ideation and attempts included gender, disappointment with school, family history of mental health issues, alcohol use, lack of social/family support, history of abuse, living arrangements, anxiety, and depression. 

Sensitivity analysis showed stable pooled estimates. Publication bias was detected for suicide attempts, but not for ideation. Heterogeneity was observed between studies and explored through subgroup and meta-regression analyses.

 Statement Text: Giving a child butter before bed can prevent nighttime awakenings due to hunger. 
 Evidence Summary: This case report details a Chinese family with three siblings diagnosed with type I sialidosis. The condition is caused by mutations in the *NEU1* gene, leading to reduced α-N-acetylneuraminidase activity.

**Methods:** The researchers presented a case series of three siblings experiencing seizures and ataxia. Diagnostic workup included whole exome sequencing to identify genetic mutations. Ethical approval was obtained, and informed consent was provided by the family.

**Population:** Three siblings from a Chinese family presenting with adolescent-onset seizures and ataxia. Parents and children were also assessed as carriers.

**Key Outcomes:** Whole exome sequencing identified a homozygous *NEU1* mutation (NM_000434.3:c.544A>G [p.Ser182Gly]) in all three affected siblings, confirming the diagnosis of type I sialidosis. Parents and children were found to be heterozygous carriers. 

**Effect Size:** Not applicable – this is a case report.

**Limitations:** This is a case report of only three individuals and therefore does not allow for generalizable conclusions. It describes clinical presentation and genetic confirmation, but does not evaluate treatment efficacy beyond antiseizure medication use and continued seizures.

 Statement Text: Giving a child butter before bed can prevent nighttime awakenings due to hunger. 
 Evidence Summary: This study protocol describes a randomized, double-masked, single-center clinical trial comparing micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (MP-TSCPC) with slow coagulation transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (SC-TSCPC) in patients with refractory glaucoma. 

The study will enroll patients aged 18 years or older with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ≤20/60, intraocular pressure (IOP) >21 mmHg. Participants will be randomized to receive either MP-TSCPC or SC-TSCPC. Follow-up examinations will occur at 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 3, 6, and 12 months post-procedure. 

The primary outcome is complete success, defined as IOP between 6-20 mmHg *and* a ≥30% reduction in IOP from baseline, without hypotensive medication. Qualified success is defined similarly, but allows for hypotensive medication use. Outcomes measured will include BCVA, IOP, slit lamp biomicroscopy, fundoscopy, and macular optical coherence tomography (OCT). The number of hypotensive medications used and any complications will also be documented.

The study is registered at the Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clínicos (ReBEC) RBR-5pckbhj and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Campinas. One author reports financial conflicts of interest (speaker fees/consulting/grants from Alcon, Allergan-Abbvie, Iridex, and Zeiss).

 Statement Text: Low blood sugar overnight can cause babies to wake up and cry. 
 Evidence Summary: This case report details a 4-month-old male infant presenting with a weak cry and subsequent discovery of hypoglycemia (blood glucose 47 mg/dL). The infant was initially evaluated for sepsis due to irritability and a high-pitched, weak cry – described as atypical for distress. Standard investigations were initially unremarkable. Hypoglycemia was discovered on repeat testing. Further investigation revealed a normal metabolic screen, ruling out common inherited metabolic disorders. The infant’s symptoms resolved with frequent feeding. 

The report highlights an unusual presentation of hypoglycemia – a weak cry – and emphasizes that atypical presentations should prompt consideration of metabolic causes even with initially normal findings. The case suggests hypoglycemia should be included in the differential diagnosis for infants with an unusual or weak cry, despite the absence of typical signs of hypoglycemia. 

Limitations acknowledged include the single-case nature of the report, preventing generalization to the broader infant population. Further research is needed to determine if a weak cry can reliably indicate hypoglycemia in other infants.

 Statement Text: Low blood sugar overnight can cause babies to wake up and cry. 
 Evidence Summary: This systematic review investigated the association between shortened preoperative fasting and perioperative outcomes in pediatric patients. Researchers searched LILACS, PubMed, and ScienceDirect for original studies published between January 2017 and November 2022, that assessed shortened fasting protocols (validated for ages 0-17 years).

Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Results indicated that shortened preoperative fasting is safe for children and adolescents. Specifically, the review found higher preoperative blood glucose levels, no reported episodes of preoperative hypoglycemia, a lower incidence of nausea, and fewer reports of crying compared to standard fasting protocols. 

The study is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies. The level of evidence is rated as Level II. No conflicts of interest were reported.

 Statement Text: Low blood sugar overnight can cause babies to wake up and cry. 
 Evidence Summary: This case report details two Filipino neonates who died within 72 hours of birth with non-specific findings. Both infants exhibited elevated long-chain acylcarnitines and hypocarnitinemia on newborn screening, suggestive of a fatty acid oxidation disorder. No confirmatory testing was possible due to early death. 

Parental carrier testing revealed both parents were heterozygous for the c.199-10T>G variant in the *SLC25A20* gene, consistent with autosomal recessive Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency (CACTD). The report identifies this as the first documented case of CACTD in the Filipino population.

The study involves only two cases and their parents; it does not include a control group or quantitative data beyond the description of the genetic variant and screening results. It’s a case report, therefore limited in its ability to establish prevalence or generalizable conclusions.

 Statement Text: Low blood sugar overnight can cause babies to wake up and cry. 
 Evidence Summary: This study investigated the effect of early comprehensive intervention—skin-to-skin contact combined with breastfeeding—on blood glucose levels in newborns of mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Researchers randomized 300 newborns (150 per group) to either the intervention group or a control group receiving standard postnatal care. 

The intervention group received early skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding, while the control group received postnatal naked contact, delayed cord clamping, and routine care. Researchers measured peripheral blood glucose at 1 and 2 hours post-birth, neonatal hospitalization rates, ear temperature at multiple time points, crying frequency, incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, uterine contraction/wound pain scores, and lactation rates.

Results showed significantly higher blood glucose levels at 1 and 2 hours post-birth in the intervention group (p<0.05). The intervention group also had a lower neonatal hospitalization rate, higher ear temperatures at all measured time points, reduced crying, lower incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, improved pain scores, and higher rates of lactation at 2 hours postpartum (all p<0.05).

The study was registered (chictr220059454) and authors report no conflicts of interest. Note: this article has been retracted.

 Statement Text: Supplementing with high-calorie foods like butter, peanut butter, avocado, or coconut milk before bed can provide sufficient calories to prevent nighttime wakings. 
 Evidence Summary: This mixed-methods study evaluated the acceptability of “Gambling Habit Hacker,” a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) for gambling problems. Researchers recruited 30 adults (18-65 years) with self-reported gambling problems via online advertisements. Participants used the JITAI for two weeks, then completed qualitative interviews.

The JITAI delivers personalized, context-dependent support via smartphone notifications, triggered by self-reported urges or contextual cues. Acceptability was assessed using the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) and thematic analysis of interview data.

Results indicated generally positive UEQ scores, suggesting good usability and acceptability. Qualitative analysis identified key themes: perceived relevance of content, appreciation of personalization, and suggestions for improving notification timing and content delivery. Participants valued the JITAI's ability to provide support *in the moment* of gambling urges. 

Limitations noted were the small sample size, recruitment via online advertising (potentially excluding those with limited digital access), and the lack of a control group, meaning conclusions about efficacy cannot be drawn. The study focused solely on acceptability, not on changes in gambling behaviour.

 Evidence Summary: This case report details three siblings from a Chinese family diagnosed with type I sialidosis, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the *NEU1* gene. The patients presented with seizures and ataxia during adolescence, with symptoms progressively worsening. 

Methods included clinical evaluation, and whole exome sequencing to identify the genetic cause. Sequencing revealed a homozygous *NEU1* mutation (NM_000434.3:c.544A>G [p.Ser182Gly]) in all three affected siblings. Parents and children were confirmed as heterozygous carriers. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the People’s Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and informed consent was obtained.

Key findings: all three siblings were diagnosed with type I sialidosis. Treatment with antiseizure medications did not prevent recurrent seizures. 

Limitations: This is a case report detailing only three individuals, thus generalizability is limited. It does not detail long-term outcomes or the efficacy of different treatment strategies.

{'transcript': "Give your kid butter before bed. It's the epic bedtime hack you've probably never heard of. Does your little one wake up multiple times a night? Yep, that was my life when my son was 12 months old. However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Alright, ready? Before bed, I started offering my son a spoonful of butter. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I felt like he was still hungry and I wanted to make sure he was getting enough calories before bedtime. And guess what? It worked like a charm. He went from waking up multiple times a night to a full night's sleep. It was a game changer, all because of butter. Now, why is this helpful? It's not uncommon for our growing babies to need more calories. Brains are rapidly developing and bodies growing bigger. If kids don't get enough calories during the day, their blood sugar can drop overnight and they'll wake up hungry and cry. Since they can't communicate their hunger, they will simply just cry. So often the only thing that will console them is the middle of the night, nursing session, or a bottle. Does that make sense? Alright, now, I can't guarantee that this will work for every child, but it's worth a try if you're feeling desperate for some sleep. And no, it does not need to be butter. It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk. Get creative. Choose something that is easy, that your child will eat and they'll love. Now, if you've already tried it and it worked for you, please share your experience in the comments below. I love hearing from other moms sharing their tips with each other. Just a reminder, every child's different. You know your baby best. Trust your instincts. And if it doesn't work for you, then we could try something else.
