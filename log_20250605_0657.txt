TASK  
Extract **medical claims** suitable for fact-checking.

SELECTION RULES  
1. Return **exactly three** distinct claims.  
2. Prefer clinically relevant, novel, or potentially harmful claims.  
3. Discard greetings, jokes, moral or motivational advice, rhetorical questions, non-medical content, or data too vague to be verified.

Example:
(
  "Smoking"[MeSH] 
  OR smoking[tiab] 
  OR smokers[tiab] 
  OR "tobacco use"[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Lung Function Tests"[MeSH]

  OR "Traumotein"[tiab] 
  OR "pine bark extract"[tiab] 
  OR Pycnogenol[tiab]
)


• Is exactly one line (no line breaks).

Leute, dieser Mann wird gecancelt, weil er gesagt hat, was wirklich hilft, um die Lunge von Schleim zu befreien. Hört gut zu. Viele Leute kämpfen mit den Auswirkungen von jahrelangem Rauchen, kriegen schwer Luft oder haben ständig Schleim in der Lunge. Und natürlich sagt euch das kein Arzt, aber OPC, also Traubenkern-Extrakt, kann helfen, die Lunge zu entgiften, von Schleim zu befreien und wieder richtig zu durchbluten. Leute, dieser Mann hat Recht mit allem, was er sagt. Ich habe nach dem Video noch etwas selbst recherchiert, und OPC, also Trauben-Kernextrakt, ist tatsächlich dafür bekannt, die Lungen von Schleim zu befreien. Außerdem fördert es die Durchblutung der Lunge massiv. Es wird sogar schon seit Jahrhunderten dafür eingesetzt und dennoch redet kein Arzt darüber. Ich selbst benutze es mittlerweile seit einem Monat. Und Leute, ich bekomme das erste Mal wieder richtig Luft und konnte wirklich jahrelang Schleim abhusten. Ich mache sogar wieder Sport. Das einzige Problem bei OPC ist allerdings, dass es rein und getestet sein sollte, da es sonst sogar ungesund sein kann. Deshalb habe ich euch eine reine und getestete Variante herausgesucht, die ich auch selbst einnehme. Wenn ihr einen orangenen Einkaufswagen unten links im Video seht, könnt ihr draufklicken und OPC direkt bestellen.

Electronic address: jeffrey.hafkin@otsuka-us.com. BACKGROUND: Quabodepistat (formerly OPC-167832) showed potent activity in preclinical studies and in the first stage of an early bactericidal activity study in adults with smear-positive, drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis. Stage 2 of this study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and early bactericidal activity of quabodepistat in combination with delamanid, bedaquiline, or both versus rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide combination therapy for 14 days. METHODS: Stage 2 of this open-label, active-controlled, randomised, parallel-group study was conducted at two research sites in South Africa in adults (aged 18-64 years) with drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis. Eligible participants had a BMI of 16-32 kg/m2 and the ability to produce an adequate volume of sputum (≥10 mL overnight) and were excluded if they had drug-resistant tuberculosis or previous treatment for Mycobacterium tuberculosis within the past 3 years. Participants were centrally randomly assigned via interactive web response technology system, with no stratification, into four treatment groups in a ratio of 14:14:14:4 (quabodepistat 30 mg plus delamanid 300 mg, quabodepistat 30 mg plus bedaquiline 400 mg, or quabodepistat 30 mg plus delamanid 300 mg plus bedaquiline 400 mg orally once daily for 14 days, or rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide combination therapy [control] according to local standard of care for 20 days). The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability during and after 14 days of treatment in all participants who received any study medication and pharmacokinetics at day 1 and day 14 in participants in the quabodepistat groups with adequate data for deriving pharmacokinetics parameters. The main secondary outcome was bactericidal activity from baseline to day 14 in all eligible participants who were quantitatively culture-positive at baseline. The study was not powered for formal statistical hypothesis testing; therefore, data were summarised by treatment group with descriptive statistics. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03678688) and is closed to new participants. FINDINGS: 98 participants were screened for entry into stage 2 of the trial between Feb 1, 2021, and Jan 27, 2022, of whom 46 were randomly assigned (14 to each quabodepistat group, 4 to the control group) and 44 received at least one dose of study medication (one patient excluded from the quabodepistat plus delamanid and quabodepistat plus bedaquiline groups). 32 (73%) of 44 participants had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. Most events (30/32 [94%]) were mild or moderate; the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (≥2 participants; not related to study drugs) were headache (4/44 [9%]), dizziness (3/44 [7%]), abdominal pain (2/44 [5%]), pruritus (2/44 [5%]), and nausea (2/44 [5%]). Two serious adverse events were reported in two participants in the quabodepistat and bedaquiline cohort (anal abscess [n=1], pneumothorax [n=1]); both were deemed not related to study drug. Quabodepistat exposure was minimally affected by coadministration of delamanid or bedaquiline, with lower exposure in the quabodepistat and bedaquiline cohorts (maximum plasma concentration for quabodepistat plus delamanid 208 ng/mL [SD 61; n=11]; quabodepistat plus bedaquiline 175 ng/mL [31; n=10]; quabodepistat plus delamanid plus bedaquiline 183 ng/mL [52; n=11]). Maximum quabodepistat concentrations were achieved approximately 3 h after administration in all combinations. Mean elimination half-life was shorter in combinations with bedaquiline than without bedaquiline (12·3-14·5 h vs 15·2 h). Mean changes from baseline to day 14 of sputum log10 colony-forming units per mL were -2·73 (SD 1·51) for quabodepistat plus delamanid plus bedaquiline (n=12) and -2·71 (SD 0·92) for control (n=19); mean change was -2·17 (SD 1·83) in the quabodepistat plus delamanid cohort (n=11) and -1·97 (SD 1·29) in the quabodepistat plus bedaquiline cohort (n=11). INTERPRETATION: In this 14-day trial, quabodepistat plus delamanid plus bedaquiline, a novel three-drug combination, appeared to be safe, well tolerated, and provided robust early bactericidal activity in adults with drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis. Further evaluation is warranted. FUNDING: Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Copyright © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This open-label, active-controlled, randomized trial investigated quabodepistat in combination with delamanid, bedaquiline, or both, compared to rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, in adults with drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis. Conducted at two South African sites, 46 participants were randomized (14 per quabodepistat group, 4 to control), with 44 receiving study medication. 

The primary outcomes were safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics. Secondary outcome was bactericidal activity over 14 days. The study was not powered for formal statistical testing; data are presented descriptively.

32/44 participants (73%) experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event, mostly mild/moderate. Serious adverse events (anal abscess, pneumothorax) occurred in two participants receiving quabodepistat and bedaquiline, deemed unrelated to study drug. Quabodepistat exposure was minimally affected by co-administration of delamanid or bedaquiline, though lower maximum concentrations were observed with bedaquiline. Mean elimination half-life was shorter with bedaquiline. Mean change in sputum colony-forming units from baseline to day 14 was -2.73 (SD 1.51) for quabodepistat + delamanid + bedaquiline and -2.71 (SD 0.92) for control.

Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) are used in products that are applied to the human body, such as cosmetics and food, but their biocompatibility remains controversial. Pycnogenol (PYC), a natural extract of pine bark, exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In this study, we investigated whether PYC effectively alleviates pulmonary toxicity induced by airway exposure to TiO2NPs, and the beneficial effects of PYC were explained through the analysis of changes to the mechanism of cytotoxicity. TiO2NPs induced pulmonary inflammation and mucus production, increased the levels of malondialdehyde, and upregulated thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) and cleaved-caspase 3 (Cas3) in the lungs of mice. However, PYC treatment reduced the levels of all toxicity markers of TiO2NPs and restored glutathione levels. These antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of PYC were also demonstrated in TiO2NP-exposed human airway epithelial cells by increasing the mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes and decreasing the expression of TXNIP, cleaved-Cas3, and inflammatory mediators. Taken together, our results showed that PYC attenuated TiO2NP-induced lung injury via TXNIP downregulation. Therefore, our results suggest the potential of PYC as an effective anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent against TiO2NP-induced pulmonary toxicity.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study investigated the effect of Pycnogenol (PYC) on lung inflammation induced by titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) in mice and human airway epithelial cells. Researchers exposed mice to TiO2NPs and either treated them with PYC or not. They also exposed human cells *in vitro* to TiO2NPs with or without PYC. 

TiO2NP exposure in mice led to pulmonary inflammation, mucus production, increased malondialdehyde levels, and upregulation of TXNIP and cleaved-caspase 3. PYC treatment reduced these markers and restored glutathione levels. *In vitro*, PYC increased mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes and decreased expression of TXNIP, cleaved-caspase 3, and inflammatory mediators in TiO2NP-exposed cells. 

The results indicate PYC attenuated TiO2NP-induced lung injury, potentially via downregulation of TXNIP. The authors suggest PYC may be an effective agent against TiO2NP-induced pulmonary toxicity. No conflicts of interest were declared.

Electronic address: cmulclo@mail.cmu.edu.tw. ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Nursing home-associated pneumonia (NHAP) is a common type of infection among long-term care residents. Moreover, the mortality of NHAP is also higher than community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the decoctions of Banxia Houpo Tang (BHT) and Ding Chuan Tang (DCT) are two formulas supporting the lungs' natural defense systems, helps to expel mucus and promote detoxification. AIM OF THE STUDY: We designed a concentrated Chinese herbal extract formula called BDT1, that combines the compounds of BHT and DCT. In this study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of BDT1 for NHAP prevention in high-risk older residents in the nursing home. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 160 participants aged over 65 years old living in the nursing home were randomly assigned 1:1 to the BDT1 and placebo group. Besides regular medicine, participants received either BDT1 or a placebo for 12 consecutive weeks. The primary outcome was the hospitalization rate for pneumonia in the intervention period and half-year follow-up. The microscopic examination of Gram-stained sputum was also evaluated before and after the trial. Data were analyzed by using the Chi-square test and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test with SPSS. RESULTS: A total of 160 participants were enrolled into two study groups in this study, which was completed with 143 participants analyzed, including 70 subjects in the BDT1 group and 73 subjects in the placebo group. After the 12-week medical treatment, the hospitalization rate for pneumonia was 10.0% and 34.2% in the BDT1 and placebo group respectively. The risk of pneumonia in half a year was lower in the BDT1 group (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.422, 95% CI = 0.226-0.791). Compared to the placebo group, the level of Gram-negative bacilli in the BDT1 group is significantly declined in sputum samples (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the cumulative incidence of pneumonia and related-hospitalization rates declined significantly after 12-weeks of BDT1 treatment. Besides, Chinese herbal medicine BDT1 is a safe therapy without hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity. Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Electronic address: jkkim@udel.edu. Acrolein (Acr) is a reactive aldehyde in the environment. Acr causes oxidative stress and a cascade of catalytic events and has, thereby, been associated with increased risk of pulmonary diseases. Whether apiaceous vegetables (API) consumption can prevent Acr-induced pulmonary toxicity has not yet been explored hence, we investigated the effects of API on Acr-induced pulmonary damages in C57BL/6J mice. The mice were assigned into either negative control [NEG group; American Institute of Nutrition (AIN)-93G diet only], positive control (POS group; AIN-93G+Acr) or API intervention group (API group; AIN-93G+21% API+Acr). After 1 week of dietary intervention, the POS and API mice were exposed to Acr (10 µmol/kg body weight/day) for 5 days. During the exposure period, assigned diets remained the same. Prominent indicators lung of toxicity of POS mice were found, including mucus accumulation, macrophage infiltration, and hemorrhage, all of which were ameliorated by the API. Serum and lung inflammation markers, such as a tumor necrosis factor alpha were also increased by Acr while reduced by API. In the liver, API upregulated expression of glutathione S-transferases, which enhanced the metabolism of Acr into water-soluble 3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic acid for excretion. This is consistent with observed reductions in serum Acr-protein adducts. Taken together, our results suggest that API may provide protection against Acr-induced pulmonary damages and inflammation via enhancement of the hepatic detoxification of Acr. Copyright © 2022.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study investigated the effects of apiaceous vegetable (API) consumption on acrolein (Acr)-induced pulmonary damage in C57BL/6J male mice. Mice were divided into three groups: a negative control (AIN-93G diet), a positive control (AIN-93G + Acr), and an API intervention group (AIN-93G + 21% API + Acr). Following a one-week diet, the positive and API groups received Acr (10 µmol/kg/day) for five days.

Results showed the API group exhibited reduced lung toxicity indicators – mucus accumulation, macrophage infiltration, and hemorrhage – compared to the positive control.  Acrolein exposure increased serum and lung inflammation markers (TNF-alpha), which were decreased with API consumption.  In the liver, API upregulated glutathione S-transferases, enhancing Acr metabolism and reducing serum Acr-protein adducts. 

The study suggests API may protect against Acr-induced pulmonary damage and inflammation by enhancing hepatic detoxification. The population was limited to male mice.

BACKGROUND: The ductus arteriosus (DA) is critical in maintaining postnatal circulation in neonates with obstructed systemic circulation (OSC) and pulmonary circulation (OPC). We hypothesized that the size of the DA and aortic isthmus (AoI) undergoes adaptive growth in utero to counteract the hemodynamic challenges in these congenital heart diseases (CHD). METHODS: Postnatal echocardiograms of neonates diagnosed prenatally with ductal-dependent CHD who were started on prostaglandins within 24 h of birth were reviewed. We assessed the cross-sectional area of the aortic valve opening, pulmonary valve opening, AoI, and DA by calculating (diameter)2/body surface area. Neonates were classified into OSC or OPC then subgrouped depending upon the patency of semilunar valves: OSC with and without aortic atresia (OSC-AA and OSC-nAA, respectively) and OPC with and without pulmonary atresia (OPC-PA and OPC-nPA, respectively). RESULTS: Ninety-four cases were studied. The DA in OSC was significantly larger than OPC, and the DA in OSC-AA was significantly larger than OSC-nAA. The size of the AoI was significantly larger in OPC than OSC and larger in OSC-AA than OSC-nAA. Within the OSC-nAA group, there was no significant difference in the size of the DA, AoI, or pulmonary valve opening between those with retrograde flow (RF) at the AoI and without (nRF) except the aortic valve opening was significantly larger in nRF. All groups had comparable cross-sectional areas of systemic output. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that DA and AoI show compensatory growth to maintain critical blood flow to vital organs against primary anatomical abnormalities in ductus-dependent CHD.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This retrospective study investigated the growth of the ductus arteriosus (DA) and aortic isthmus (AoI) in neonates with ductus-dependent congenital heart disease (CHD). Researchers reviewed postnatal echocardiograms of 94 neonates diagnosed prenatally with CHD and initiated on prostaglandins within 24 hours of birth. 

Patients were classified into obstructed systemic circulation (OSC) or obstructed pulmonary circulation (OPC) groups, further subdivided by semilunar valve patency (atresia vs. non-atresia). The cross-sectional area of the aortic valve, pulmonary valve, AoI, and DA were calculated, normalized to body surface area.

Results showed the DA was significantly larger in OSC compared to OPC, and larger in OSC with aortic atresia (OSC-AA) versus OSC without aortic atresia. Conversely, the AoI was larger in OPC than OSC, and larger in OSC-AA. Within the OSC without aortic atresia group, those with retrograde flow at the AoI had larger aortic valve openings. Systemic output was comparable across all groups.

The authors conclude that the DA and AoI undergo compensatory growth in ductus-dependent CHD, potentially to maintain blood flow despite anatomical abnormalities. The study is limited by its retrospective design.

Inflammation in pulmonary arterioles initiates and maintains pathological processes in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and inhibition of it attenuates PAH development. Grape seed proanthocyanidin (GSP) is believed to be effective in protecting vascular system via inhibiting inflammation, while its effect on pulmonary circulation remains inconclusive. In this study, we made observations in monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH rats and found decreases in mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary vessel resistance, right ventricular hypertrophy index, percentage of medial wall thickness, percentage of medial wall area, and lung weight of wet and dry tissue ratio after GSP administration in vivo. At the cellular and molecular levels, we also found several effects of GSP on MCT-induced PAH: (a) endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression in lung tissue and plasma NO level were increased; (b) Ca2+ level in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC) was decreased; (c) transcription of inflammatory factors such as myeloperoxidase, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) was down-regulated in lung tissue; (d) nuclear factor-κB pathway was inhibited as IκBα was less phosphorylated; (e) TNFα-induced PASMC overproliferation could be inhibited. These results indicated a possible mechanism of GSP reversing pulmonary vascular remodeling and vascular contraction by inhibiting inflammation, and it may be useful for preventing PAH development.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study investigated the effects of grape seed proanthocyanidin (GSP) on monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in rats. Researchers used an *in vivo* model of MCT-induced PAH, administering GSP to rats and measuring physiological parameters including mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary vessel resistance, and right ventricular hypertrophy. *In vitro* cellular effects were also assessed. 

Results showed that GSP administration *in vivo* led to decreases in mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary vessel resistance, right ventricular hypertrophy index, and lung wet/dry weight ratio. At a cellular level, GSP increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression and plasma nitric oxide levels, decreased calcium levels in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells, and downregulated transcription of inflammatory factors (myeloperoxidase, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) in lung tissue. Inhibition of the nuclear factor-κB pathway (via reduced IκBα phosphorylation) and TNFα-induced PASMC overproliferation were also observed. 

The study suggests GSP may reverse pulmonary vascular remodeling and contraction by inhibiting inflammation in PAH. Limitations include reliance on an animal model and a specific PAH inducer (MCT); therefore, direct translation to human PAH is uncertain.

 Statement Text: Grape seed extract (OPC) can detoxify the lungs and remove mucus. 
 Evidence Summary: This open-label, active-controlled, randomized trial investigated quabodepistat in combination with delamanid, bedaquiline, or both, compared to rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, in adults with drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis. Conducted at two South African sites, 46 participants were randomized (14 per quabodepistat group, 4 to control), with 44 receiving study medication. 

The primary outcomes were safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics. Secondary outcome was bactericidal activity over 14 days. The study was not powered for formal statistical testing; data are presented descriptively.

32/44 participants (73%) experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event, mostly mild/moderate. Serious adverse events (anal abscess, pneumothorax) occurred in two participants receiving quabodepistat and bedaquiline, deemed unrelated to study drug. Quabodepistat exposure was minimally affected by co-administration of delamanid or bedaquiline, though lower maximum concentrations were observed with bedaquiline. Mean elimination half-life was shorter with bedaquiline. Mean change in sputum colony-forming units from baseline to day 14 was -2.73 (SD 1.51) for quabodepistat + delamanid + bedaquiline and -2.71 (SD 0.92) for control. 

The study was funded by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

 Statement Text: Grape seed extract (OPC) can detoxify the lungs and remove mucus. 
 Evidence Summary: This study investigated the effect of Pycnogenol (PYC) on lung inflammation induced by titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) in mice and human airway epithelial cells. Researchers exposed mice to TiO2NPs and either treated them with PYC or not. They also exposed human cells *in vitro* to TiO2NPs with or without PYC. 

TiO2NP exposure in mice led to pulmonary inflammation, mucus production, increased malondialdehyde levels, and upregulation of TXNIP and cleaved-caspase 3. PYC treatment reduced these markers and restored glutathione levels. *In vitro*, PYC increased mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes and decreased expression of TXNIP, cleaved-caspase 3, and inflammatory mediators in TiO2NP-exposed cells. 

The results indicate PYC attenuated TiO2NP-induced lung injury, potentially via downregulation of TXNIP. The authors suggest PYC may be an effective agent against TiO2NP-induced pulmonary toxicity. No conflicts of interest were declared.

 Evidence Summary: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigated the efficacy and safety of a concentrated Chinese herbal extract formula (BDT1) for pneumonia prevention in high-risk older adults residing in nursing homes. 160 participants aged 65+ were randomized 1:1 to receive either BDT1 or placebo for 12 weeks, in addition to regular care. 143 participants completed the study (70 in BDT1 group, 73 in placebo group).

The primary outcome was hospitalization rate for pneumonia during the 12-week intervention and a 6-month follow-up period.  The hospitalization rate for pneumonia was 10.0% in the BDT1 group and 34.2% in the placebo group. The adjusted hazard ratio for pneumonia risk over half a year was 0.422 (95% CI 0.226-0.791).  Microscopic sputum examination showed a significant decline in Gram-negative bacilli in the BDT1 group compared to placebo (p<0.05). 

The study concluded that BDT1 significantly reduced the cumulative incidence of pneumonia and related hospitalizations. No hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity was reported.

 Statement Text: Grape seed extract (OPC) can detoxify the lungs and remove mucus. 
 Evidence Summary: This study investigated the effects of apiaceous vegetable (API) consumption on acrolein (Acr)-induced pulmonary damage in C57BL/6J male mice. Mice were divided into three groups: a negative control (AIN-93G diet), a positive control (AIN-93G + Acr), and an API intervention group (AIN-93G + 21% API + Acr). Following a one-week diet, the positive and API groups received Acr (10 µmol/kg/day) for five days.

Results showed the API group exhibited reduced lung toxicity indicators – mucus accumulation, macrophage infiltration, and hemorrhage – compared to the positive control.  Acrolein exposure increased serum and lung inflammation markers (TNF-alpha), which were decreased with API consumption.  In the liver, API upregulated glutathione S-transferases, enhancing Acr metabolism and reducing serum Acr-protein adducts. 

The study suggests API may protect against Acr-induced pulmonary damage and inflammation by enhancing hepatic detoxification. The population was limited to male mice.

{'transcript': 'Leute, dieser Mann wird gecancelt, weil er gesagt hat, was wirklich hilft, um die Lunge von Schleim zu befreien. Hört gut zu. Viele Leute kämpfen mit den Auswirkungen von jahrelangem Rauchen, kriegen schwer Luft oder haben ständig Schleim in der Lunge. Und natürlich sagt euch das kein Arzt, aber OPC, also Traubenkern-Extrakt, kann helfen, die Lunge zu entgiften, von Schleim zu befreien und wieder richtig zu durchbluten. Leute, dieser Mann hat Recht mit allem, was er sagt. Ich habe nach dem Video noch etwas selbst recherchiert, und OPC, also Trauben-Kernextrakt, ist tatsächlich dafür bekannt, die Lungen von Schleim zu befreien. Außerdem fördert es die Durchblutung der Lunge massiv. Es wird sogar schon seit Jahrhunderten dafür eingesetzt und dennoch redet kein Arzt darüber. Ich selbst benutze es mittlerweile seit einem Monat. Und Leute, ich bekomme das erste Mal wieder richtig Luft und konnte wirklich jahrelang Schleim abhusten. Ich mache sogar wieder Sport. Das einzige Problem bei OPC ist allerdings, dass es rein und getestet sein sollte, da es sonst sogar ungesund sein kann.
