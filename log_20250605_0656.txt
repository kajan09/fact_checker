Give your kid butter before bed. It's the epic bedtime hack you've probably never heard of. Does your little one wake up multiple times a night? Yep, that was my life when my son was 12 months old. However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Alright, ready? Before bed, I started offering my son a spoonful of butter. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I felt like he was still hungry and I wanted to make sure he was getting enough calories before bedtime. And guess what? It worked like a charm. He went from waking up multiple times a night to a full night's sleep. It was a game changer, all because of butter. Now, why is this helpful? It's not uncommon for our growing babies to need more calories. Brains are rapidly developing and bodies growing bigger. If kids don't get enough calories during the day, their blood sugar can drop overnight and they'll wake up hungry and cry. Since they can't communicate their hunger, they will simply just cry. So often the only thing that will console them is the middle of the night, nursing session, or a bottle. Does that make sense? Alright, now, I can't guarantee that this will work for every child, but it's worth a try if you're feeling desperate for some sleep. And no, it does not need to be butter. It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk. Get creative. Choose something that is easy, that your child will eat and they'll love. Now, if you've already tried it and it worked for you, please share your experience in the comments below. I love hearing from other moms sharing their tips with each other. Just a reminder, every child's different. You know your baby best. Trust your instincts. And if it doesn't work for you, then we could try something else. Something.

1. Simpson-Golabi-Behmel Syndrome Type 1. Nisbet AF(1)(2), Hathaway ER(1), Kalish JM(1)(2). In: Adam MP, Feldman J, Mirzaa GM, Pagon RA, Wallace SE, Amemiya A, editors. GeneReviews(®) [Internet]. Seattle (WA): University of Washington, Seattle; 1993–2025. 2006 Dec 19 [updated 2024 Nov 14]. Author information: (1)Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (2)Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 1 (SGBS1) is characterized by pre- and postnatal macrosomia; distinctive craniofacial features (including macrocephaly, coarse facial features, macrostomia, macroglossia, and palate abnormalities); and, commonly, mild-to-severe intellectual disability with or without structural brain anomalies. Other variable findings include supernumerary nipples, diastasis recti / umbilical hernia, congenital heart defects, diaphragmatic hernia, genitourinary defects, and gastrointestinal issues. Skeletal anomalies can include vertebral fusion, scoliosis, rib anomalies, and congenital hip dislocation. Hand anomalies can include large hands and postaxial polydactyly. Affected individuals are at increased risk for embryonal tumors including Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, adrenal neuroblastoma, gonadoblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and medulloblastoma. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of SGBS1 is established in a male proband with suggestive findings and/or a hemizygous pathogenic variant in GPC3 or an intragenic or whole-gene deletion of GPC3 identified by molecular genetic testing. The diagnosis is usually established in a female proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in GPC3 or an intragenic or whole-gene deletion of GPC3 identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Prompt treatment of neonatal hypoglycemia and airway obstruction resulting from micrognathia and glossoptosis. Treatment of cleft lip and/or cleft palate or macroglossia and related feeding difficulties, obstructive sleep apnea, ophthalmologic issues, hearing loss, heart defects, urogenital abnormalities, skeletal abnormalities, seizures, Wilms tumor, and other types of tumors per standard recommendations by appropriate pediatric specialists. Speech therapy as needed. Neurodevelopmental assessment to determine the need for special education, occupational therapy, and/or physical therapy. Surveillance: Screening for Wilms tumor and hepatoblastoma with abdominal ultrasound and serum AFP level every three months from time of diagnosis until age three years; renal ultrasound every three months until age seven years; no specific tumor screening protocol has been established for neuroblastoma, gonadoblastoma, or medulloblastoma, but follow up with a cancer predisposition specialist every six months is recommended. Annual (or as indicated) ophthalmologic and audiologic evaluations in childhood; sleep study if there are concerns about sleep dysregulation including sleep apnea; routine monitoring of kidney function if renal anomalies are present; evaluation for scoliosis at least annually or during periods of rapid growth; monitoring of serum glucose level in the neonatal period; monitoring of developmental progress at each visit through adolescence. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing of the GPC3 pathogenic variant in the family in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from preventive measures such as tumor surveillance. Pregnancy management: Gestational hypertension, diabetes, preeclampsia, fetal distress, and preterm labor have all been described in case reports of pregnancies of fetuses diagnosed with SGBS1. Polyhydramnios has been reported in 68% of pregnancies affected with SGBS1. Fetal macrocephaly and overgrowth may necessitate cesarean delivery or early induction of labor. GENETIC COUNSELING: SGBS1 is inherited in an X-linked manner. If the mother of the proband has a pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected. Females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be carriers, although due to X-chromosome inactivation, carrier females may have manifestations of SGBS1. Males with SGBS1 will pass the pathogenic variant to all their daughters and none of their sons. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk are possible for families in which the pathogenic variant has been identified.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This GeneReview details Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 1 (SGBS1), an X-linked genetic disorder. The review synthesizes information on clinical characteristics, diagnosis, management, and genetic counselling. 

Diagnosis is established through molecular genetic testing identifying pathogenic variants in the *GPC3* gene in both males and females with suggestive clinical findings. 

Clinical features include pre- and postnatal macrosomia, distinctive facial features (macrocephaly, coarse features, large mouth/tongue, palate abnormalities), and often mild-to-severe intellectual disability. Other findings are variable, including skeletal anomalies, hand anomalies, and increased risk of embryonal tumors (Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, etc.).

Management focuses on treating manifestations, including neonatal complications like hypoglycemia and airway obstruction, and specialist care for associated issues. Surveillance for tumors (Wilms and hepatoblastoma with ultrasound/AFP screening until age three, renal ultrasound to age seven) is recommended. 

Genetic counselling notes that SGBS1 is X-linked, with a 50% chance of transmission from an affected mother to each child. Carrier testing and prenatal testing are possible once the familial pathogenic variant is identified. X-inactivation can lead to variable expression in carrier females.

1. Medium-Chain Acyl-Coenzyme A Dehydrogenase Deficiency. Chang IJ(1), Lam C(2), Vockley J(3). In: Adam MP, Feldman J, Mirzaa GM, Pagon RA, Wallace SE, Amemiya A, editors. GeneReviews(®) [Internet]. Seattle (WA): University of Washington, Seattle; 1993–2025. 2000 Apr 20 [updated 2024 Sep 26]. Author information: (1)Assistant Professor, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California (2)Associate Professor, University of Washington;, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington (3)Professor, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Individuals with medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency typically appear normal at birth, and many are diagnosed through newborn screening programs. Symptomatic individuals experience hypoketotic hypoglycemia in response to either prolonged fasting (e.g., weaning the infant from nighttime feedings) or during intercurrent and common infections (e.g., viral gastrointestinal or upper respiratory tract infections), which typically cause loss of appetite and increased energy requirements when fever is present. Untreated severe hypoglycemic episodes can be accompanied by seizures, vomiting, lethargy, coma, and death. Metabolic decompensation during these episodes can result in elevated liver transaminases and hyperammonemia. Individuals with MCAD deficiency who have experienced the effects of uncontrolled metabolic decompensation are also at risk for chronic myopathy. Early identification and avoidance of prolonged fasting can ameliorate these findings. However, children with MCAD deficiency are at risk for obesity after initiation of treatment due to the frequency of feeding. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of MCAD deficiency is established in a proband through biochemical testing (prominent accumulation of C8-acylcarnitine (octanoylcarnitine) with lesser elevations of C6-, C10-, and C10:1-acylcarnitines and elevated C8/C2 and C8/C10 ratios) AND/OR by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in ACADM by molecular genetic testing OR by significantly reduced activity of MCAD activity in blood or cultured skin fibroblasts. Because of its relatively high sensitivity, ACADM molecular genetic testing can obviate the need for enzymatic testing, which is available only in limited academic centers. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: For routine daily treatment, fasting should be avoided and may require frequent feeding (every 2-3 hours) in infancy, overnight feeding, a bedtime snack, or 2 g/kg of uncooked cornstarch to maintain blood glucose levels during sleep. A normal, healthy diet containing no more than 30% of total energy from fat is recommended. All individuals with MCAD deficiency should avoid skipping meals and weight loss diets that recommend fasting. Prolonged or intense exercise should be covered by adequate carbohydrate intake and hydration. Intravenous glucose is recommended for surgical procedures that require several hours of fasting. Weight control measures such as regular education about proper nutrition and recommended physical exercise should be discussed to help avoid obesity. Standard treatment for developmental delay / aphasia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and muscle weakness. For acute inpatient treatment, IV administration of glucose should be initiated immediately with 10% dextrose with appropriate electrolytes at a rate of 1.5 times maintenance rate or at 10-12 mg glucose/kg/minute to achieve and maintain a blood glucose level higher than 5 mmol/L, or between 120 and 170 mg/dL. Address electrolyte and pH imbalances with intravenous fluid management and initiate appropriate treatment for what triggered the metabolic stress. Surveillance: Infants should establish care with a biochemical genetics clinic including a metabolic dietitian as soon as possible following a positive newborn screen. A metabolic dietician should be involved to ensure proper nutrition in terms of quality and quantity. Affected infants should be seen in team clinic in two to three months, then every six to 12 months if otherwise clinically well; however, the frequency of routine follow-up visits is individualized based on comfort level of the affected persons, their families, and health care providers. Routine assessments for growth, acquisition of developmental milestones, neurobehavioral issues, and secondary carnitine deficiency are recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Hypoglycemia; infant formulas, coconut oil, and other manufactured foods containing medium-chain triglycerides as the primary source of fat; popular high-fat/low-carbohydrate diets; alcohol consumption, in particular acute alcohol intoxication (e.g., binge drinking), which can elicit metabolic decompensation; aspirin. Pregnancy management: Pregnant women who have MCAD deficiency must avoid catabolism. This is supported by several case reports describing carnitine deficiency, acute liver failure, and HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) in pregnant women with MCAD deficiency. GENETIC COUNSELING: MCAD deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, the sibs of an affected individual are at a 25% risk of being affected, a 50% risk of being asymptomatic carriers, and a 25% risk of being unaffected and not carriers. Because of the high carrier frequency for the ACADM c.985A>G pathogenic variant in individuals of northern European origin, carrier testing should be discussed with reproductive partners of individuals with MCAD deficiency. Once both ACADM pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for MCAD deficiency are possible.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This GeneReviews entry details Medium-Chain Acyl-Coenzyme A Dehydrogenase (MCAD) Deficiency, an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. The clinical presentation typically begins in infancy or early childhood, manifesting as hypoketotic hypoglycemia following fasting or illness. Untreated, this can lead to seizures, coma, and death; chronic myopathy is also a risk.

Diagnosis is established through biochemical testing (elevated C8-acylcarnitine) and/or identification of pathogenic variants in the *ACADM* gene, with genetic testing often sufficient. 

Management focuses on preventing hypoglycemia via frequent feeding (every 2-3 hours in infancy) and avoiding prolonged fasting. A normal diet with moderate fat intake is recommended. Acute episodes require immediate intravenous glucose administration (1.5x maintenance rate or 10-12mg/kg/min) and electrolyte correction. 

Surveillance involves regular follow-up with a biochemical genetics clinic and dietitian, monitoring growth, development, and neurobehavioral status.  Individuals with MCAD deficiency should avoid high-fat diets, coconut oil, alcohol, and aspirin. Pregnant women require careful management to prevent catabolism. Genetic counseling indicates a 25% recurrence risk for siblings, with carrier testing available for reproductive partners.

(3)INFANT Research Centre, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland. The burden of treatment (BOT) related to propranolol treatment for infantile hemangiomas (IH) has never previously been explored. A modified validated questionnaire, the Treatment Burden Questionnaire, and one-on-one semi-structured interviews were used to assess the BOT for propranolol for IH. Out of 80 caregivers, the overall burden score was very low at 1.2 out of 10; thematic analysis of interviews grouped themes into administration, monitoring, financial, and associated anomalies. The BOT of propranolol for IH is very low but could be reduced further by offering age-based risk stratification related to feeding frequency and risk of hypoglycemia, pragmatic advice around timing of doses before sleep, and reducing frequency of vital sign monitoring. © 2024 The Authors.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): O'Connor and Murphy (2024) investigated the treatment burden (BOT) associated with propranolol use for infantile hemangiomas (IH). The study employed a mixed-methods approach, using a modified validated questionnaire (Treatment Burden Questionnaire) and semi-structured interviews with 80 caregivers. 

The overall BOT score was low, averaging 1.2 out of 10. Thematic analysis of interview data identified four key themes contributing to treatment burden: administration of medication, monitoring for side effects, financial costs, and associated anomalies/complications. 

The authors suggest potential strategies to further reduce BOT, including age-based risk stratification to optimise feeding schedules and minimise hypoglycaemia risk, practical advice on timing doses, and reducing the frequency of vital sign monitoring. 

The study population was limited to caregivers of children receiving propranolol for IH at a single centre, which may limit generalisability.

Correspondence to: Dr.Vijayalakshmi Bhatia, Department of Endocrinology, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India, 226014. bhatiaviji@gmail.com. OBJECTIVE: To document glycemic patterns during school and sleep by continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) in school-going children with type 1 diabetes. To correlate glycemia with meal composition. METHODS: Patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 22) aged 4 to 19 years were enrolled. Food recording was taught, and a retrospective CGMS sensor was worn by them for 6 to 14 days. Dietary composition and glycemic patterns during school and sleep were analyzed. RESULTS: The mean (SD) of dietary carbohydrate was 62.9 (9.2)% of daily calories (high) and protein 13 (2.5) % (low). Sensor glucose > 180 mg/dL (hyperglycemia) was detected on 73% of 139 school day CGMS records and involved 58 % of the school time. Sensor glucose < 70 mg/dL (hypoglycemia) was present on 45% of 172 nights. Time below range was 20 (25) %. Mean (SD) protein content (g) of dinner was significantly higher when it included lentil (dal) than without [20.4 (9.7) vs 15.3 (8.3); P < 0.001]. Hypoglycemia occurred less often on nights with vs without dal for dinner (42.1% vs 51.7%; P = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycemia during school hours was notable. The inclusion of lentil (dal) in the night meal in the traditional diet may reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia. PMID: 38217266 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This retrospective study investigated glycemic patterns in 22 children (ages 4-19) with Type 1 Diabetes using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data collected over 6-14 days. Participants kept food records, which were used to correlate dietary composition with CGM readings during school and sleep.

Results showed a high mean dietary carbohydrate intake of 62.9% of daily calories and low protein at 13%. Hyperglycemia (sensor glucose >180mg/dL) was detected in 73% of school day CGM records, encompassing 58% of school time. Hypoglycemia (sensor glucose <70mg/dL) occurred in 45% of nights, with 20% of time spent below range. 

Protein intake was significantly higher with lentil (dal) included in dinner [20.4g (9.7)] compared to dinners without [15.3g (8.3); P<0.001]. Nights *with* dal were associated with less frequent hypoglycemia (42.1%) compared to nights *without* dal (51.7%; P=0.048).

The study concludes that hyperglycemia is common during school hours and that including lentil in the evening meal may reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia.

Quantitative results indicated high scores for usability (System Usability Scale mean = 78.5, SD = 11.8) and acceptability (Technology Acceptance Model scores: perceived usefulness M=4.0, SD=0.8; perceived ease of use M=4.2, SD=0.7). Qualitative analysis of interviews identified themes of intervention relevance, personalization, and timing as key drivers of acceptability. Participants valued the intervention’s ability to provide support in moments of craving or urge. 

Limitations noted by the authors include a convenience sample, potentially limiting generalizability. The study focused on acceptability rather than efficacy; therefore, it does not demonstrate whether the intervention reduces gambling harms.

INTRODUCTION: Suicide is a major public health problem and one of the top causes of death among adolescents worldwide. The Ethiopian government works to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being in adolescents through the National Adolescent and Youth Mental Health Strategy. Despite these efforts, suicide in adolescents remains pressing in Ethiopia; however, study findings regarding suicidal ideation and suicide attempts and their associated factors in high school adolescents have been inconsistent and non-conclusive. Therefore, this review aimed to assess the pooled national prevalence and risk factors of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guideline was followed for this systematic review. We searched PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases. We included all observational studies that report the prevalence and associated factors of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. Using a standard data extraction format, two authors separately extracted all required data. The meta-analysis was conducted using Stata version 17 statistical software. The Cochrane Q test and I² statistics were employed to evaluate the heterogeneity among the included studies. Pooled prevalence estimates, along with their 95% confidence intervals, were calculated using a random-effects model. Potential sources of heterogeneity across studies were further explored through subgroup analyses, sensitivity analysis, and meta-regression analysis. RESULT: The review comprised ten studies with 8,620 participants. Out of 1,451 studies identified, 10 studies were included in the analysis. As the random effect model indicated that the pooled prevalence of suicide ideation and suicide attempt among high school adolescents in Ethiopia was 16% (95% CI: 12%, 19%) and 10% (95% CI: 6%, 13%), respectively. The highest prevalence of suicidal ideation was observed after the country's implementation of HSTP II [18 (95% CI: 15-22), I²=83.94, P-value < 0.001], while the lowest prevalence was depicted in adolescents aged 10-19 years [11% (95% CI 10, 13), I²=93.3, P-value < 0.001]. Similarly, the highest pooled prevalence of suicide attempt was observed after the country's implementation of HSTP II [12% (95% CI: 10-13), I²=67.77, P-value < 0.03], while the lowest prevalence was depicted in adolescents aged 10-19 years [5% (95% CI 1, 9), I²=94.43, P-value < 0.001]. The sensitivity analysis indicated that none of the point estimates were outside of the overall 95% confidence interval. No publication bias was seen in suicide ideation. But evidence of publication bias for suicide attempts was identified through the left trim and fill analysis. Gender, disappointment with school results, family history, alcohol use, the presence or absence of family or social support, history of abuse, living arrangement of adolescent, anxiety, and depression were significantly associated with suicide ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. CONCLUSION: This review revealed that a significant proportion of high school adolescents had suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in Ethiopia. Therefore, the government and all stakeholders should track the outcome of the suicide prevention project under HSTP II and other initiatives. In addition, emphasis should be given to disadvantaged adolescents, including females, orphans, alcohol users, and mentally challenged adolescents. Furthermore, school-based interventions like social support and suicide prevention initiatives shall be promoted. © 2025. The Author(s).

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the prevalence and risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. The researchers searched PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, following PRISMA guidelines. Ten observational studies, including 8,620 participants, were included in the analysis.

The pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation was 16% (95% CI: 12-19%), and the pooled prevalence of suicide attempts was 10% (95% CI: 6-13%). Higher prevalence of both outcomes was observed after the implementation of HSTP II. Lower prevalence was seen in adolescents aged 10-19 years. 

Significant factors associated with both suicidal ideation and attempts included gender, disappointment with school results, family history, alcohol use, lack of family/social support, history of abuse, living arrangement, anxiety, and depression. Sensitivity analysis showed consistent point estimates. Publication bias was identified for suicide attempts, but not for ideation. The Cochrane Q test and I² statistics indicated heterogeneity among the included studies.

(#)Contributed equally BACKGROUND: Sialidosis is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease characterized by the mutation of neuraminidase-1 (NEU1) gene, resulting in decreased activity of α-N-acetylneuraminidase. This leads to metabolic abnormalities in various organs. Sialidosis is classified into two distinct clinical phenotypes, type I and type II, based on the age of onset and severity of clinical manifestations. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a case involving a patient and his two sisters, all of whom showed seizures and ataxia during adolescence, with progressively worsening symptoms. Prior to admission, none of the patients had received a systemic diagnosis or treatment. The whole exome sequencing identified a homozygous NEU1 mutation (NM_000434.3:c.544A > G [p.Ser182Gly]) in all three siblings. Their parents and children, who were asymptomatic, were found to be heterozygous carriers. The three patients were ultimately diagnosed with type I sialidosis and treated with antiseizure medications, but they continued to experience recurrent seizures. CONCLUSIONS: This case report enhances our understanding of sialidosis, particularly in patients presenting with seizures and ataxia. Furthermore, the gene sequencing is a crucial tool for confirming the diagnosis of sialidosis and provides a valuable approach for genetic counseling in affected families. © 2025. The Author(s).

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This case report details three siblings from a Chinese family diagnosed with type I sialidosis, a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the *NEU1* gene. The patients presented with seizures and ataxia during adolescence, with symptoms progressively worsening. 

Methods included clinical evaluation, and whole exome sequencing to identify the causative genetic mutation. Sequencing revealed a homozygous *NEU1* mutation (NM_000434.3:c.544A>G [p.Ser182Gly]) in all three affected siblings. Parents and children were confirmed as heterozygous carriers. Ethical approval was obtained and informed consent was provided by the family.

Key findings: all three siblings were diagnosed with type I sialidosis based on genetic testing. Treatment with antiseizure medication did not fully control recurrent seizures. 

Limitations: This is a case report detailing only three individuals, thus precluding generalizable conclusions. The report does not detail long-term outcomes or response to other potential therapies.

Micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation versus slow coagulation in refractory glaucoma: study protocol of a randomized clinical trial. de Lima Neto CR(1), de Cabral Vasconcellos JP(2), Silva SGNE(2), Costa VP(2). Author information: (1)Department of Ophthalmology, University of Campinas, 251 Vital Brazil St, Campinas, São Paulo, 13083-888, Brazil. cesarlimaneto@yahoo.com.br. (2)Department of Ophthalmology, University of Campinas, 251 Vital Brazil St, Campinas, São Paulo, 13083-888, Brazil. BACKGROUND: Traditional continuous diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TCW-TSCPC) has been used for decades to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) by decreasing aqueous humor (AH) production in patients with glaucoma. Micropulse cyclophotocoagulation (MP-TSCPC) and slow coagulation (SC-TSCPC) are the newest transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TSCPC) techniques that result in lower inflammation and complication rates compared to the traditional technique. Most publications on TSCPC are case series with a retrospective design with different treatment protocols. The objective of this manuscript is to describe the protocol of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) designed to compare the efficacy and safety of MP-TSCPC and SC-TSCPC in patients with refractory glaucoma followed for 12 months. METHODS: This is a parallel, double-arm single-center, double-masked, RCT that will include eyes with refractory glaucoma. Patients with corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ≤ 20/60, IOP > 21 mmHg, and age ≥ 18 years will be randomized to cyclophotocoagulation using the SC-TSCPC or MP-TSCPC techniques. Follow-up visits will be 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 3, 6, and 12 months after the procedure. Complete success will be defined as an IOP between 6 and 20 mmHg and a minimum of 30% IOP reduction from baseline, without hypotensive medications. Qualified success will be defined by the same parameters but allowing the use of medication. All follow-up examinations will include determination of BCVA, IOP measurement, slit lamp biomicroscopy, fundoscopy, and macular optical coherence tomography (OCT). The number of hypotensive medications and the occurrence of complications will also be documented. DISCUSSION: Our study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of the two most used TSCPC techniques. Most published studies are retrospective and compare the two new techniques only with the traditional technique. This is, to our knowledge, the first RCT comparing MP-TSCPC and SC-TSCPC techniques.

 Statement Text: Offering a child butter or other high-calorie foods before bed can prevent nighttime awakenings caused by low blood sugar. 
 Evidence Summary: This GeneReview details Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 1 (SGBS1), an X-linked genetic disorder. The review synthesizes information on clinical characteristics, diagnosis, management, and genetic counselling. 

Diagnosis is established through molecular genetic testing identifying pathogenic variants in the *GPC3* gene in both males and females with suggestive clinical findings. 

Clinical features include pre- and postnatal macrosomia, distinctive facial features (macrocephaly, coarse features, large mouth/tongue, palate abnormalities), and often mild-to-severe intellectual disability. Other findings are variable, including skeletal anomalies, hand anomalies, and increased risk of embryonal tumors (Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, etc.).

Management focuses on treating manifestations, including neonatal complications like hypoglycemia and airway obstruction, and specialist care for associated issues. Surveillance for tumors (Wilms and hepatoblastoma with ultrasound/AFP screening until age three, renal ultrasound to age seven) is recommended. 

Genetic counselling notes that SGBS1 is X-linked, with a 50% chance of transmission from an affected mother to each child. Carrier testing and prenatal testing are possible once the familial pathogenic variant is identified. X-inactivation can lead to variable expression in carrier females.

 Statement Text: Offering a child butter or other high-calorie foods before bed can prevent nighttime awakenings caused by low blood sugar. 
 Evidence Summary: This GeneReviews entry details Medium-Chain Acyl-Coenzyme A Dehydrogenase (MCAD) Deficiency, an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. The clinical presentation typically begins in infancy or early childhood, manifesting as hypoketotic hypoglycemia following fasting or illness. Untreated, this can lead to seizures, coma, and death; chronic myopathy is also a risk.

Diagnosis is established through biochemical testing (elevated C8-acylcarnitine) and/or identification of pathogenic variants in the *ACADM* gene, with genetic testing often sufficient. 

Management focuses on preventing hypoglycemia via frequent feeding (every 2-3 hours in infancy) and avoiding prolonged fasting. A normal diet with moderate fat intake is recommended. Acute episodes require immediate intravenous glucose administration (1.5x maintenance rate or 10-12mg/kg/min) and electrolyte correction. 

Surveillance involves regular follow-up with a biochemical genetics clinic and dietitian, monitoring growth, development, and neurobehavioral status.  Individuals with MCAD deficiency should avoid high-fat diets, coconut oil, alcohol, and aspirin. Pregnant women require careful management to prevent catabolism. Genetic counseling indicates a 25% recurrence risk for siblings, with carrier testing available for reproductive partners.

 Statement Text: Offering a child butter or other high-calorie foods before bed can prevent nighttime awakenings caused by low blood sugar. 
 Evidence Summary: O'Connor and Murphy (2024) investigated the treatment burden (BOT) associated with propranolol use for infantile hemangiomas (IH). The study employed a mixed-methods approach, using a modified validated questionnaire (Treatment Burden Questionnaire) and semi-structured interviews with 80 caregivers. 

The overall BOT score was low, averaging 1.2 out of 10. Thematic analysis of interview data identified four key themes contributing to treatment burden: administration of medication, monitoring for side effects, financial costs, and associated anomalies/complications. 

The authors suggest potential strategies to further reduce BOT, including age-based risk stratification to optimise feeding schedules and minimise hypoglycaemia risk, practical advice on timing doses, and reducing the frequency of vital sign monitoring. 

The study population was limited to caregivers of children receiving propranolol for IH at a single centre, which may limit generalisability.

 Statement Text: Offering a child butter or other high-calorie foods before bed can prevent nighttime awakenings caused by low blood sugar. 
 Evidence Summary: This retrospective study investigated glycemic patterns in 22 children (ages 4-19) with Type 1 Diabetes using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data collected over 6-14 days. Participants kept food records, which were used to correlate dietary composition with CGM readings during school and sleep.

Results showed a high mean dietary carbohydrate intake of 62.9% of daily calories and low protein at 13%. Hyperglycemia (sensor glucose >180mg/dL) was detected in 73% of school day CGM records, encompassing 58% of school time. Hypoglycemia (sensor glucose <70mg/dL) occurred in 45% of nights, with 20% of time spent below range. 

Protein intake was significantly higher with lentil (dal) included in dinner [20.4g (9.7)] compared to dinners without [15.3g (8.3); P<0.001]. Nights *with* dal were associated with less frequent hypoglycemia (42.1%) compared to nights *without* dal (51.7%; P=0.048).

The study concludes that hyperglycemia is common during school hours and that including lentil in the evening meal may reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia.

 Evidence Summary: This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the prevalence and risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. The researchers searched PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, following PRISMA guidelines. Ten observational studies, including 8,620 participants, were included in the analysis.

The pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation was 16% (95% CI: 12-19%), and the pooled prevalence of suicide attempts was 10% (95% CI: 6-13%). Higher prevalence of both outcomes was observed after the implementation of HSTP II. Lower prevalence was seen in adolescents aged 10-19 years. 

Significant factors associated with both suicidal ideation and attempts included gender, disappointment with school results, family history, alcohol use, lack of family/social support, history of abuse, living arrangement, anxiety, and depression. Sensitivity analysis showed consistent point estimates. Publication bias was identified for suicide attempts, but not for ideation. The Cochrane Q test and I² statistics indicated heterogeneity among the included studies.

{'transcript': "Give your kid butter before bed. It's the epic bedtime hack you've probably never heard of. Does your little one wake up multiple times a night? Yep, that was my life when my son was 12 months old. However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Alright, ready? Before bed, I started offering my son a spoonful of butter. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I felt like he was still hungry and I wanted to make sure he was getting enough calories before bedtime. And guess what? It worked like a charm. He went from waking up multiple times a night to a full night's sleep. It was a game changer, all because of butter. Now, why is this helpful? It's not uncommon for our growing babies to need more calories. Brains are rapidly developing and bodies growing bigger. If kids don't get enough calories during the day, their blood sugar can drop overnight and they'll wake up hungry and cry. Since they can't communicate their hunger, they will simply just cry. So often the only thing that will console them is the middle of the night, nursing session, or a bottle. Does that make sense? Alright, now, I can't guarantee that this will work for every child, but it's worth a try if you're feeling desperate for some sleep. And no, it does not need to be butter. It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk. Get creative. Choose something that is easy, that your child will eat and they'll love.
