Did you know that starving yourself can reverse your age, repair damaged cells, and increase your brain power with just one easy health hack? It sounds so unrealistic you would think I'm lying to you. But I'm not! I'm not lying! These are all recorded benefits of fasting. There are literally tons of religions and ancient cultures that practice fasting as a way to regulate health, discipline, and spirit. And modern science proves that they were onto something. Ancient divine wisdom and nerds in lab coats agreeing on something being good for you should be all the evidence that you need. And here's what we know that fasting can do for you. Discard old and damaged cells and replace them with new ones. Purifies your brain function with less toxicity flowing through your body. Raises your willpower because it's a form of discipline training. Raises your ketone levels and helps with metabolism. And obviously if you're not eating as much, you're going to lose weight. And the research varies on how long you're supposed to fast for, but to get these types of benefits, it sounds like the minimum is 24 hours. I go anywhere from 36 to 48 and I do it once a week. And in the next video, I'll walk you through how I do it. Do it.

Background/Objectives: Obesity accelerates metabolic aging through oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) are nutrient-sensing pathways regulating metabolism. AMPK promotes energy metabolism and autophagy, while excessive mTOR activity contributes to aging. Intermittent fasting (IF), including time-restricted feeding (TRF)-limiting food intake to a 6 h window (18:6)-and alternate-day modified fasting (ADMF)-alternating 24 h fasting (≤25% daily caloric intake) with unrestricted feeding-may improve metabolic regulation. However, their effects on AMPK, mTOR, and metabolic age remain unclear. Methods: This quasi-experimental pre-test-post-test control group study compared the TRF and ADMF on metabolic age, AMPK, and mTOR in young obese women. Twenty-four participants (mean age: 21.29 ± 1.76 years; body fat: 36.92 ± 3.18%; BMI: 29.68 ± 3.70 kg/m2) were initially matched by BMI and assigned to Control, TRF, and ADMF groups. A total of 4 participants (1 Control, 3 ADMF) were excluded due to outlier values, yielding final group sizes: Control (n = 7), TRF (n = 8), and ADMF (n = 5). The intervention lasted 20 days. Results: A significant decrease in AMPK levels was observed in the ADMF group (p = 0.043), while changes in the TRF and Control groups were not significant. mTOR levels showed a decreasing trend but were not statistically significant. No significant changes were found in metabolic age. Conclusions: Twenty days of intermittent fasting intervention did not significantly affect AMPK, mTOR, or metabolic age in young obese women. TRF may more effectively enhance AMPK and reduce mTOR, while ADMF may better reduce metabolic age.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This quasi-experimental study investigated the effects of two intermittent fasting (IF) variations—time-restricted feeding (TRF; 6h eating window) and alternate-day modified fasting (ADMF; 24h fast/unrestricted feed)—on metabolic age, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in young obese women.

Researchers recruited 24 participants (mean age 21.29 years, mean BMI 29.68 kg/m², body fat 36.92%) and assigned them to Control, TRF, and ADMF groups. Four participants were excluded due to outlier values, leaving final group sizes of 7, 8, and 5 respectively. The intervention lasted 20 days.

Results showed a significant decrease in AMPK levels in the ADMF group (p=0.043). mTOR levels showed a decreasing trend across groups but were not statistically significant. No significant changes were observed in metabolic age. 

The authors conclude that 20 days of IF did not significantly affect AMPK, mTOR, or metabolic age in this population, but suggest TRF may more effectively enhance AMPK and reduce mTOR, while ADMF may better reduce metabolic age.

(4)German Center for Lung Research, Airway Research Center North, Kiel/Borstel, Germany. Time-restricted feeding (TRF), a dietary intervention involving daily fasting periods, has been associated with metabolic benefits; however, its long-term physiological impact remains unclear. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model, we investigated the effects of a 16:8 TRF regimen on lifespan, reproductive output, gut health, and microbiota composition. TRF significantly extended lifespan, even when applied only during early adulthood. Notably, this longevity benefit occurred without compromising reproductive fitness, as measured by female fecundity in life's most crucial reproductive phase. TRF promoted gut homeostasis in aged flies by reducing intestinal stem cell proliferation and enhancing epithelial barrier integrity. Furthermore, TRF induced a shift in microbiota composition, increasing the prevalence of gram-negative bacterial taxa. These results show that even short-term TRF interventions at a young age can have long-term physiological benefits. Metabolic reprogramming or increased autophagy are the most likely mechanisms mediating the health-promoting effects of this type of nutritional intervention. TRF is an effective, non-invasive strategy for promoting healthy longevity without significant adverse effects on other aspects of life. © 2025 The Author(s).

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study investigated the effects of time-restricted feeding (TRF – a 16:8 regimen) on health and lifespan using *Drosophila melanogaster* (fruit flies). Researchers assessed lifespan, reproductive output (fecundity), gut health (intestinal stem cell proliferation and epithelial barrier integrity), and gut microbiota composition.

TRF significantly extended lifespan, even when implemented during early adulthood. This longevity benefit was observed *without* negatively impacting reproductive fitness. TRF also improved gut health in aged flies by reducing stem cell proliferation and enhancing barrier integrity. Analysis of the gut microbiota revealed a shift in composition, with an increase in gram-negative bacteria following TRF. 

The study suggests TRF may promote healthy longevity through mechanisms like metabolic reprogramming or increased autophagy. Authors declare no conflicts of interest. The research was conducted using a fruit fly model; results may not directly translate to humans.

A Novel Research Paradigm for Sarcopenia of Limb Muscles: Lessons From the Perpetually Working Diaphragm's Anti-Aging Mechanisms. Li E(1), Wang R(2), Li Y(2), Zan X(3), Wu S(1), Yin Y(1), Yang X(1), Yin L(1), Zhang Y(1), Li J(1), Zhao X(1), Zhang C(1).

(3)The Neurosurgery Department of Shanxi Provincial People's Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China. BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle function and mass continuously decrease during aging. Most studies target limb muscles owing to their direct impact on mobility and falls risk. The diaphragm (DIA), also a type of skeletal muscle with different phenotype, has received less attention. Comparative research of the DIA and limb muscles can reveal their distinct aging characteristics. Critically, the potential endogenous anti-aging mechanisms of DIA that may provide new insights into the mechanisms of sarcopenia in limb muscles remain scarce. METHODS: Treadmill and grip tests assessed limb muscle function, while a lung function system evaluated respiratory function in both adult (6-month-old) and old (22-month-old) mice. Histological assessments evaluated muscle mass in both the DIA and tibialis anterior (TA). Transcriptome sequencing identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the DIA and TA with aging. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-encoding short hairpin (sh) RNA targeting gene was injected into adult mice's TA muscles to knockdown target gene level in TA, and AAV-gene was injected into old mice's TA to overexpress target gene level. RESULTS: Old mice displayed significantly reduced running distance (p = 0.0026), maximal speed (p = 0.0019), time to exhaustion (p = 0.0033) and grip strength (p = 0.0055) compared with adult mice, alongside TA's weight loss, decreased myofibre cross-sectional area (CSA) and autophagy deficiency. However, lung function indicators (respiratory rate, tidal volume, minute ventilation volume, forced vital capacity and ratio of forced expiratory volume in 100 or 200 ms to forced vital capacity), as well as DIA weight and morphology remained stable in old mice. Transcriptional analysis revealed 61 DEGs, with significant upregulation or downregulation observed in TA, but without changes in DIA during aging. Smox (spermine oxidase) is one of the DEGs, responsible for catalysing the conversion of spermine to spermidine. It was reported that in muscle atrophy models such as limb immobilisation, fasting and denervation, Smox's levels are positively correlated with muscle mass and function. Additionally, an increase in Smox also promotes mitochondrial biogenesis. In our study, AAV-shSmox adult mice decreased running distance, speed and time, myofibre CSA alongside mitochondrial function, compared with controls. In contrast, old mice with Smox overexpression showed enhanced mitochondrial function. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study reveals aging diversities of TA and DIA, explores the sarcopenia of limb muscles based on the anti-aging properties of DIA, which offers a novel perspective on limb sarcopenia. Our findings suggest Smox as a potential target for developing strategies to mitigate sarcopenia progression. © 2025 The Author(s).

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study investigated age-related differences in skeletal muscle between the diaphragm (DIA) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles in mice. Researchers compared 6-month-old (adult) and 22-month-old (old) mice, assessing limb function via treadmill and grip tests, respiratory function, muscle mass (via histology measuring myofibre cross-sectional area), and gene expression (RNA sequencing).

Old mice showed significant declines in running distance (p=0.0026), speed (p=0.0019), endurance (p=0.0033) and grip strength (p=0.0055), accompanied by TA weight loss and reduced myofibre CSA. Respiratory function and DIA characteristics remained stable with age. Transcriptomic analysis identified 61 differentially expressed genes in the TA, but not the DIA, during aging. 

The gene *Smox* was identified as a potential target. Knockdown of *Smox* in adult mice via AAV-shRNA reduced running performance and mitochondrial function. Conversely, overexpression of *Smox* in old mice improved mitochondrial function. 

The authors conclude that the DIA exhibits resistance to age-related decline compared to limb muscles, and *Smox* may be a therapeutic target for sarcopenia.

Ceccarelli Ceccarelli D(1), Solerte SB(2). Author information: (1)Geriatric Medicine Department, Morgagni-Pierantoni Hospital, Via Carlo Forlanini 34, 47121 Forlì, Italy. (2)Geriatric and Diabetology Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Pavia, Corso Strada Nuova 63, 27100 Pavia, Italy. Background: Aging is characterized by shared cellular and molecular processes, and aging-related diseases might co-exist in a cluster of comorbidities, particularly in vulnerable individuals whose phenotype meets the criteria for frailty. Whilst the multidimensional definition of frailty is still controversial, there is an increasing understanding of the common pathways linking metabolic syndrome, cognitive decline, and sarcopenia, frequent conditions in frail elderly patients. Methods: We performed a systematic search in the electronic databases Cochrane Library and PubMed and included preclinical studies, cohort and observational studies, and trials. Discussion: Metabolic syndrome markers, such as insulin resistance and the triglyceride/HDL C ratio, correlate with early cognitive impairment. Insulin resistance is a cause of synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Conversely, fasting and fasting-mimicking agents promote neuronal resilience by enhancing mitochondrial efficiency, autophagy, and neurogenesis. Proteins acting as cellular metabolic sensors, such as SIRT1, play a pivotal role in aging, neuroprotection, and metabolic health. In AD, β-amyloid accumulation and hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles can cause metabolic reprogramming in brain cells, shifting from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, similar to the Warburg effect in cancer. The interrelation of metabolic syndrome, sarcopenia, and cognitive decline suggests that targeting these shared metabolic pathways could mitigate all the conditions. Pharmacological interventions, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, metformin, and SIRT 1 inducers, demonstrated neuroprotective effects in animals and some preliminary clinical models. Conclusions: These findings encourage further research on the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases as well as the drug-repurposing potential of molecules currently approved for diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This systematic review examined the shared pathways linking metabolic syndrome, mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and sarcopenia. The authors conducted a search of Cochrane Library and PubMed, including preclinical studies, cohort/observational studies, and trials. 

The review found correlations between metabolic syndrome markers (insulin resistance, triglyceride/HDL C ratio) and early cognitive impairment, with insulin resistance implicated in synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Interventions like fasting and fasting-mimicking agents showed potential to enhance neuronal resilience via mitochondrial efficiency, autophagy, and neurogenesis. The study highlights the role of proteins like SIRT1 in aging, neuroprotection, and metabolic health. 

In Alzheimer’s Disease, β-amyloid accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation were linked to metabolic reprogramming in brain cells, shifting to aerobic glycolysis. The authors suggest targeting shared metabolic pathways may mitigate these conditions, and note preliminary evidence from animal and some clinical models for neuroprotective effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists, metformin, and SIRT1 inducers.

The review concludes by encouraging further research into prevention/treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and drug repurposing. No conflicts of interest were declared.

(4)Department of Anesthesiology, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. Preoperative baseline cognitive impairment is associated with postoperative neurocognitive disorder (PND). Fasting, and more generally, calorie restriction has been shown to exert controversial effects in clinical settings and various animal models of neurological disorders. Every patient needs acute fasting before anesthesia and surgery. However, the impact of acute fasting on cognitive function remain largely unknown. We, therefore, set out to determine whether acute fasting can induce neurotoxicity and neurobehavioral deficits in rodents. In the present system establishment study, a mouse model of acute fasting was established. The effects of the acute fasting on natural and learned behavior were evaluated in the buried food test, open field test and the Y maze test. The expression of c-Fos, the marker of neuronal activation, and caspase-3 activation, the marker of cellular apoptosis, were measured with immunohistochemistry. We found that the 9 h acute fasting increased the latency to eat food in the buried food test. The acute fasting also selectively increased the total distance and decreased the freezing time in open field test, and increased the duration in the novel arm in the Y maze test. Besides, the immunohistochemical study showed that the fasting significantly increased the c-Fos level in the hippocampus and various sub-cortical areas, including paraventricular thalamus (PVT), dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), lateral hypothalamus (LH), and basal amygdala (BMA). However, the acute fasting did not induce apoptosis, demonstrating by no appearance of caspase-3 activation in the corresponding brain areas. These data showed that acute fasting did not cause cellular apoptosis and cognitive impairment in the mice. Instead, the acute fasting increased the neuronal activity, enhanced the ambulatory activity and improved the spatial recognition memory in the mice. These findings will promote more research in the established system to further determine the effects of perioperative factors on the postoperative neurocognitive function and the underlying mechanisms.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): **Study:** Zheng et al. (2019) *Frontiers in Neuroscience*

**Methods:** This study investigated the impact of 9-hour acute fasting on cognitive function in mice. Researchers used behavioral tests – buried food test, open field test, and Y maze – to assess natural and learned behaviors. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure c-Fos (neuronal activation marker) and caspase-3 (apoptosis marker) expression in brain tissue.

**Population:** The study used a mouse model.

**Key Outcomes:** Fasting increased latency to find buried food. It also increased total distance traveled and decreased freezing time in the open field test, and increased time spent in the novel arm of the Y maze. Immunohistochemistry showed increased c-Fos levels in the hippocampus, PVT, DMH, LH, and BMA, but no caspase-3 activation was observed.

**Effect Size:** The study reports changes in behavioral test metrics (latency, distance, time) and c-Fos expression levels, but does not quantify effect sizes.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to a mouse model; results may not translate directly to humans. The study only examined a single duration of fasting (9 hours).

A mixed methods systematic review of multimodal non-pharmacological interventions to improve cognition for people with dementia. Chalfont G(1), Milligan C(1), Simpson J(1). Author information: (1)Division of Health Research, Faculty of Health and Medicine, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK. OBJECTIVE: Multimodal non-pharmacological interventions have been argued to have the potential to complement current pharmacological approaches to improving quality of life for people living with dementia. The aim of this review was to identify, synthesise and appraise the evidence for the effectiveness of multimodal non-pharmacological interventions for improving cognitive function specifically. METHOD: After a comprehensive search strategy including grey literature, 26 studies were reviewed. The inclusion criteria concerned adults with a primary diagnosis of dementia. Studies used two or more different modes of intervention, and measured a cognitive outcome. Due to differences in the conceptualisations of the term ‘multimodal’, a typology of modes and methods was developed to facilitate classification of candidate studies. RESULTS: Twenty-one group studies and five case studies were found. Group studies used two or three modes of intervention and multiple methods to implement them. Interventions utilised were cognitive, physical, psychological and psychosocial, nutrition, fasting, gut health, sleep hygiene, stress reduction, detoxification, hormonal health and oxygen therapy. Five individual case studies were found in two separate papers. Each personalised patient treatment utilised in-depth assessments and prescribed up to nine different modes. In 19 (90%) of the 21 group comparisons, participants were reported to have cognitive improvements, stability with their dementia or a delay in their decline. The extent of these improvements in terms of meaningful clinical change was variable. CONCLUSION: Multimodal non-pharmacological interventions have the potential to complement singular therapeutic approaches by addressing multiple modifiable risk factors currently understood to contribute towards cognitive decline.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This systematic review examined the effectiveness of multimodal non-pharmacological interventions for improving cognitive function in people with dementia. Researchers conducted a comprehensive search, including grey literature, and identified 26 studies – 21 group studies and 5 case studies – meeting the inclusion criteria of a primary dementia diagnosis and use of two or more intervention modes.

Interventions included cognitive, physical, psychological, psychosocial, nutritional, and lifestyle approaches (e.g., sleep hygiene, stress reduction). Group studies used two to three intervention modes. Case studies involved highly personalised treatments utilising up to nine modes, based on in-depth assessments.

Results from the 21 group studies indicated cognitive improvements, stability, or delayed decline in 19 (90%) of comparisons. The extent of clinically meaningful change varied. The review notes the interventions address multiple modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline. 

The review is limited by the variability in study designs and the diverse conceptualisations of ‘multimodal’ interventions, necessitating a developed typology for classification.

Accumulation of toxic protein aggregates in the nerve cells is a hallmark of neuronal diseases and brain aging. Mechanisms to enhance neuronal surveillance to improve neuronal proteostasis have a direct impact on promoting neuronal health and forestalling age-related decline in brain function. Autophagy is a lysosomal degradative pathway pivotal for neuronal protein quality control. Different types of autophagic mechanisms participate in protein handling in neurons. Macroautophagy targets misfolded and aggregated proteins in autophagic vesicles to the lysosomes for destruction, while chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) degrades specific soluble cytosolic proteins delivered to the lysosomes by chaperones. Dysfunctions in macroautophagy and CMA contribute to proteo- and neuro-toxicity associated with neurodegeneration and aging. Thus, augmenting or preserving both autophagic mechanisms pose significant benefits in delaying physiological and pathological neuronal demises. Recently, life-style interventions that modulate metabolite ketone bodies, energy intake by caloric restriction and energy expenditure by exercise have shown to enhance both autophagy and brain health. However, to what extent these interventions affect neuronal autophagy to promote brain fitness remains largely unclear. Here, we review the functional connections of how macroautophagy and CMA are affected by ketone bodies, caloric restriction and exercise in the context of neurodegeneration. A concomitant assessment of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is performed to reveal the conserved nature of such autophagic responses to substrate perturbations. In doing so, we provide novel insights and integrated evidence for a potential adjuvant therapeutic strategy to intervene in the neuronal decline in neurodegenerative diseases by controlling both macroautophagy and CMA fluxes favorably.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This review article examines the relationship between augmenting brain metabolism and autophagy – specifically macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) – as a potential strategy to reduce neuronal proteotoxicity and aging. The authors reviewed evidence connecting these autophagic mechanisms to ketone bodies, caloric restriction, and exercise. 

The review integrates findings from studies across model organisms, including *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, to demonstrate conserved autophagic responses to metabolic perturbations. It highlights that both macroautophagy and CMA are crucial for neuronal protein quality control, and dysfunction in either contributes to neurodegeneration and aging. 

The authors propose that lifestyle interventions modulating ketone bodies, energy intake, and expenditure may enhance autophagy and promote brain health. The review aims to provide a basis for potential therapeutic strategies to intervene in neuronal decline by favorably controlling macroautophagy and CMA flux.

Dietary composition modulates brain mass and solubilizable Abeta levels in a mouse model of aggressive Alzheimer's amyloid pathology. Pedrini S(1), Thomas C, Brautigam H, Schmeidler J, Ho L, Fraser P, Westaway D, Hyslop PS, Martins RN, Buxbaum JD, Pasinetti GM, Dickstein DL, Hof PR, Ehrlich ME, Gandy S. Author information: (1)Farber Institute for the Neurosciences, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia PA USA. samuel.gandy@mssm.edu. OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Recently, an increased interest in the role diet plays in the pathology of AD has resulted in a focus on the detrimental effects of diets high in cholesterol and fat and the beneficial effects of caloric restriction. The current study examines how dietary composition modulates cerebral amyloidosis and neuronal integrity in the TgCRND8 mouse model of AD. METHODS: From 4 wks until 18 wks of age, male and female TgCRND8 mice were maintained on one of four diets: (1) reference (regular) commercial chow; (2) high fat/low carbohydrate custom chow (60 kcal% fat/30 kcal% protein/10 kcal% carbohydrate); (3) high protein/low carbohydrate custom chow (60 kcal% protein/30 kcal% fat/10 kcal% carbohydrate); or (4) high carbohydrate/low fat custom chow (60 kcal% carbohydrate/30 kcal% protein/10 kcal% fat). At age 18 wks, mice were sacrificed, and brains studied for (a) wet weight; (b) solubilizable Abeta content by ELISA; (c) amyloid plaque burden; (d) stereologic analysis of selected hippocampal subregions. RESULTS: Animals receiving a high fat diet showed increased brain levels of solubilizable Abeta, although we detected no effect on plaque burden. Unexpectedly, brains of mice fed a high protein/low carbohydrate diet were 5% lower in weight than brains from all other mice. In an effort to identify regions that might link loss of brain mass to cognitive function, we studied neuronal density and volume in hippocampal subregions. Neuronal density and volume in the hippocampal CA3 region of TgCRND8 mice tended to be lower in TgCRND8 mice receiving the high protein/low carbohydrate diet than in those receiving the regular chow. Neuronal density and volume were preserved in CA1 and in the dentate gyrus. INTERPRETATION: Dissociation of Abeta changes from brain mass changes raises the possibility that diet plays a role not only in modulating amyloidosis but also in modulating neuronal vulnerability. However, in the absence of a study of the effects of a high protein/low carbohydrate diet on nontransgenic mice, one cannot be certain how much, if any, of the loss of brain mass exhibited by high protein/low carbohydrate diet-fed TgCRND8 mice was due to an interaction between cerebral amyloidosis and diet. Given the recent evidence that certain factors favor the maintenance of cognitive function in the face of substantial structural neuropathology, we propose that there might also exist factors that sensitize brain neurons to some forms of neurotoxicity, including, perhaps, amyloid neurotoxicity. Identification of these factors could help reconcile the poor clinicopathological correlation between cognitive status and structural neuropathology, including amyloid pathology.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): **Study Summary: Dietary Composition and Alzheimer’s Pathology in TgCRND8 Mice**

This study investigated the impact of dietary composition on amyloid pathology and neuronal integrity in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (TgCRND8 mice). From 4 to 18 weeks of age, mice were fed one of four diets: regular chow, high fat/low carbohydrate, high protein/low carbohydrate, or high carbohydrate/low fat. Brains were analyzed at 18 weeks for wet weight, solubilizable amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels, plaque burden, and neuronal density/volume in the hippocampus.

Results showed that a high-fat diet increased solubilizable Abeta levels, but did not affect plaque burden. Mice on a high-protein/low-carbohydrate diet had brains 5% lighter than other groups. Stereological analysis revealed a trend towards lower neuronal density and volume in the CA3 region of the hippocampus in mice fed the high-protein/low-carbohydrate diet, compared to those on regular chow. No differences were seen in CA1 or the dentate gyrus.

The study suggests a dissociation between changes in Abeta and brain mass, indicating diet may influence neuronal vulnerability independently of amyloid deposition. The authors note that without a comparison group of non-transgenic mice, it's unclear how much of the observed brain mass loss is due to interaction between diet and amyloid pathology.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This mixed-methods study evaluated the acceptability of “Gambling Habit Hacker,” a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) designed for individuals with gambling problems. Researchers recruited 25 adults with problem gambling via online advertisements. Participants used the JITAI for one week, then completed qualitative interviews.

Quantitative data included system usage metrics. Qualitative data, gathered through semi-structured interviews (n=25), explored user experiences and perceptions of the intervention’s content and functionality. 

Results indicated high levels of engagement with the JITAI. Participants reported the content was relevant, useful, and delivered at appropriate times. Key themes from interviews included perceived helpfulness of personalized feedback, the convenience of mobile delivery, and suggestions for further refinement of the intervention’s features.

Limitations noted include the small sample size and recruitment via online advertisements, potentially limiting generalizability. The one-week usage period also restricts conclusions about long-term acceptability and effectiveness.

INTRODUCTION: Suicide is a major public health problem and one of the top causes of death among adolescents worldwide. The Ethiopian government works to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being in adolescents through the National Adolescent and Youth Mental Health Strategy. Despite these efforts, suicide in adolescents remains pressing in Ethiopia; however, study findings regarding suicidal ideation and suicide attempts and their associated factors in high school adolescents have been inconsistent and non-conclusive. Therefore, this review aimed to assess the pooled national prevalence and risk factors of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guideline was followed for this systematic review. We searched PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases. We included all observational studies that report the prevalence and associated factors of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. Using a standard data extraction format, two authors separately extracted all required data. The meta-analysis was conducted using Stata version 17 statistical software. The Cochrane Q test and I² statistics were employed to evaluate the heterogeneity among the included studies. Pooled prevalence estimates, along with their 95% confidence intervals, were calculated using a random-effects model. Potential sources of heterogeneity across studies were further explored through subgroup analyses, sensitivity analysis, and meta-regression analysis. RESULT: The review comprised ten studies with 8,620 participants. Out of 1,451 studies identified, 10 studies were included in the analysis. As the random effect model indicated that the pooled prevalence of suicide ideation and suicide attempt among high school adolescents in Ethiopia was 16% (95% CI: 12%, 19%) and 10% (95% CI: 6%, 13%), respectively. The highest prevalence of suicidal ideation was observed after the country's implementation of HSTP II [18 (95% CI: 15-22), I²=83.94, P-value < 0.001], while the lowest prevalence was depicted in adolescents aged 10-19 years [11% (95% CI 10, 13), I²=93.3, P-value < 0.001]. Similarly, the highest pooled prevalence of suicide attempt was observed after the country's implementation of HSTP II [12% (95% CI: 10-13), I²=67.77, P-value < 0.03], while the lowest prevalence was depicted in adolescents aged 10-19 years [5% (95% CI 1, 9), I²=94.43, P-value < 0.001]. The sensitivity analysis indicated that none of the point estimates were outside of the overall 95% confidence interval. No publication bias was seen in suicide ideation. But evidence of publication bias for suicide attempts was identified through the left trim and fill analysis. Gender, disappointment with school results, family history, alcohol use, the presence or absence of family or social support, history of abuse, living arrangement of adolescent, anxiety, and depression were significantly associated with suicide ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. CONCLUSION: This review revealed that a significant proportion of high school adolescents had suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in Ethiopia. Therefore, the government and all stakeholders should track the outcome of the suicide prevention project under HSTP II and other initiatives. In addition, emphasis should be given to disadvantaged adolescents, including females, orphans, alcohol users, and mentally challenged adolescents. Furthermore, school-based interventions like social support and suicide prevention initiatives shall be promoted. © 2025. The Author(s).

The researchers searched PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. Ten observational studies encompassing 8,620 participants were included.

The pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation was 16% (95% CI: 12%, 19%), and the pooled prevalence of suicide attempts was 10% (95% CI: 6%, 13%). Higher prevalence of both outcomes was observed after implementation of the HSTP II program, while lower prevalence was found in adolescents aged 10-19 years. 

Significant factors associated with both suicidal ideation and attempts included gender, disappointment with school results, family history, alcohol use, lack of family/social support, history of abuse, living arrangement, anxiety, and depression. Evidence of publication bias was found for suicide attempts, but not for suicidal ideation. Sensitivity analysis showed no studies significantly altered the overall confidence intervals. The Cochrane Q test and I² statistics indicated substantial heterogeneity among the included studies.

(#)Contributed equally BACKGROUND: Sialidosis is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease characterized by the mutation of neuraminidase-1 (NEU1) gene, resulting in decreased activity of α-N-acetylneuraminidase. This leads to metabolic abnormalities in various organs. Sialidosis is classified into two distinct clinical phenotypes, type I and type II, based on the age of onset and severity of clinical manifestations. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a case involving a patient and his two sisters, all of whom showed seizures and ataxia during adolescence, with progressively worsening symptoms. Prior to admission, none of the patients had received a systemic diagnosis or treatment. The whole exome sequencing identified a homozygous NEU1 mutation (NM_000434.3:c.544A > G [p.Ser182Gly]) in all three siblings. Their parents and children, who were asymptomatic, were found to be heterozygous carriers. The three patients were ultimately diagnosed with type I sialidosis and treated with antiseizure medications, but they continued to experience recurrent seizures. CONCLUSIONS: This case report enhances our understanding of sialidosis, particularly in patients presenting with seizures and ataxia. Furthermore, the gene sequencing is a crucial tool for confirming the diagnosis of sialidosis and provides a valuable approach for genetic counseling in affected families. © 2025. The Author(s).

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This case report details three siblings from a Chinese family diagnosed with type I sialidosis, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the *NEU1* gene. The patients presented with seizures and ataxia during adolescence, with symptoms progressively worsening. 

Methods included clinical assessment, and whole exome sequencing to identify the causative genetic mutation. Sequencing revealed a homozygous *NEU1* mutation (NM_000434.3:c.544A>G [p.Ser182Gly]) in all three affected siblings. Parents and children were heterozygous carriers, but asymptomatic. Diagnosis was confirmed via genetic testing.

Key outcomes: the report confirms the genetic basis of sialidosis in these patients. All three siblings were diagnosed with type I sialidosis and treated with antiseizure medications, however seizures continued. 

Limitations: this is a case report describing only three individuals, which limits generalizability. The report does not detail the severity of ataxia, or other clinical features beyond seizures. It focuses on diagnosis and does not evaluate the long-term effects of treatment. Ethics approval was obtained and informed consent received from the family.

Micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation versus slow coagulation in refractory glaucoma: study protocol of a randomized clinical trial. de Lima Neto CR(1), de Cabral Vasconcellos JP(2), Silva SGNE(2), Costa VP(2). Author information: (1)Department of Ophthalmology, University of Campinas, 251 Vital Brazil St, Campinas, São Paulo, 13083-888, Brazil. cesarlimaneto@yahoo.com.br. (2)Department of Ophthalmology, University of Campinas, 251 Vital Brazil St, Campinas, São Paulo, 13083-888, Brazil. BACKGROUND: Traditional continuous diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TCW-TSCPC) has been used for decades to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) by decreasing aqueous humor (AH) production in patients with glaucoma. Micropulse cyclophotocoagulation (MP-TSCPC) and slow coagulation (SC-TSCPC) are the newest transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TSCPC) techniques that result in lower inflammation and complication rates compared to the traditional technique. Most publications on TSCPC are case series with a retrospective design with different treatment protocols. The objective of this manuscript is to describe the protocol of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) designed to compare the efficacy and safety of MP-TSCPC and SC-TSCPC in patients with refractory glaucoma followed for 12 months. METHODS: This is a parallel, double-arm single-center, double-masked, RCT that will include eyes with refractory glaucoma. Patients with corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ≤ 20/60, IOP > 21 mmHg, and age ≥ 18 years will be randomized to cyclophotocoagulation using the SC-TSCPC or MP-TSCPC techniques. Follow-up visits will be 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 3, 6, and 12 months after the procedure. Complete success will be defined as an IOP between 6 and 20 mmHg and a minimum of 30% IOP reduction from baseline, without hypotensive medications. Qualified success will be defined by the same parameters but allowing the use of medication. All follow-up examinations will include determination of BCVA, IOP measurement, slit lamp biomicroscopy, fundoscopy, and macular optical coherence tomography (OCT). The number of hypotensive medications and the occurrence of complications will also be documented. DISCUSSION: Our study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of the two most used TSCPC techniques. Most published studies are retrospective and compare the two new techniques only with the traditional technique. This is, to our knowledge, the first RCT comparing MP-TSCPC and SC-TSCPC techniques.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study protocol describes a randomized, double-masked, single-center clinical trial comparing micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (MP-TSCPC) with slow coagulation transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (SC-TSCPC) in patients with refractory glaucoma. 

The study will enroll patients aged 18 years or older with corrected visual acuity ≤20/60 and intraocular pressure (IOP) >21 mmHg. Participants will be randomized to either MP-TSCPC or SC-TSCPC. Follow-up examinations will occur at 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 3, 6, and 12 months post-procedure. 

Outcomes will assess IOP reduction and include a definition of ‘complete success’ (IOP 6-20 mmHg and ≥30% IOP reduction from baseline, without hypotensive medications) and ‘qualified success’ (same parameters, allowing medication use). Examinations will include visual acuity, IOP measurement, biomicroscopy, fundoscopy, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). The number of hypotensive medications and complications will also be recorded. 

The trial was registered retrospectively (RBR-5pckbhj) and approved by the University of Campinas Ethics Committee in May 2023. One investigator (VPC) reports financial conflicts of interest with Alcon, Allergan-Abbvie, Iridex, and Zeiss.

 Statement Text: Fasting can reverse age and repair damaged cells. 
 Evidence Summary: This quasi-experimental study investigated the effects of two intermittent fasting (IF) variations—time-restricted feeding (TRF; 6h eating window) and alternate-day modified fasting (ADMF; 24h fast/unrestricted feed)—on metabolic age, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in young obese women.

Researchers recruited 24 participants (mean age 21.29 years, mean BMI 29.68 kg/m², body fat 36.92%) and assigned them to Control, TRF, and ADMF groups. Four participants were excluded due to outlier values, leaving final group sizes of 7, 8, and 5 respectively. The intervention lasted 20 days.

Results showed a significant decrease in AMPK levels in the ADMF group (p=0.043). mTOR levels showed a decreasing trend across groups but were not statistically significant. No significant changes were observed in metabolic age. 

The authors conclude that 20 days of IF did not significantly affect AMPK, mTOR, or metabolic age in this population, but suggest TRF may more effectively enhance AMPK and reduce mTOR, while ADMF may better reduce metabolic age.

 Statement Text: Fasting can reverse age and repair damaged cells. 
 Evidence Summary: This study investigated the effects of time-restricted feeding (TRF – a 16:8 regimen) on health and lifespan using *Drosophila melanogaster* (fruit flies). Researchers assessed lifespan, reproductive output (fecundity), gut health (intestinal stem cell proliferation and epithelial barrier integrity), and gut microbiota composition.

TRF significantly extended lifespan, even when implemented during early adulthood. This longevity benefit was observed *without* negatively impacting reproductive fitness. TRF also improved gut health in aged flies by reducing stem cell proliferation and enhancing barrier integrity. Analysis of the gut microbiota revealed a shift in composition, with an increase in gram-negative bacteria following TRF. 

The study suggests TRF may promote healthy longevity through mechanisms like metabolic reprogramming or increased autophagy. Authors declare no conflicts of interest. The research was conducted using a fruit fly model; results may not directly translate to humans.

 Evidence Summary: This study investigated age-related differences in skeletal muscle between the diaphragm (DIA) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles in mice. Researchers compared 6-month-old (adult) and 22-month-old (old) mice, assessing limb function via treadmill and grip tests, respiratory function, muscle mass (via histology measuring myofibre cross-sectional area), and gene expression (RNA sequencing).

Old mice showed significant declines in running distance (p=0.0026), speed (p=0.0019), endurance (p=0.0033) and grip strength (p=0.0055), accompanied by TA weight loss and reduced myofibre CSA. Respiratory function and DIA characteristics remained stable with age. Transcriptomic analysis identified 61 differentially expressed genes in the TA, but not the DIA, during aging. 

The gene *Smox* was identified as a potential target. Knockdown of *Smox* in adult mice via AAV-shRNA reduced running performance and mitochondrial function. Conversely, overexpression of *Smox* in old mice improved mitochondrial function. 

The authors conclude that the DIA exhibits resistance to age-related decline compared to limb muscles, and *Smox* may be a therapeutic target for sarcopenia.

 Statement Text: Fasting can reverse age and repair damaged cells. 
 Evidence Summary: This systematic review examined the shared pathways linking metabolic syndrome, mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and sarcopenia. The authors conducted a search of Cochrane Library and PubMed, including preclinical studies, cohort/observational studies, and trials. 

The review found correlations between metabolic syndrome markers (insulin resistance, triglyceride/HDL C ratio) and early cognitive impairment, with insulin resistance implicated in synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Interventions like fasting and fasting-mimicking agents showed potential to enhance neuronal resilience via mitochondrial efficiency, autophagy, and neurogenesis. The study highlights the role of proteins like SIRT1 in aging, neuroprotection, and metabolic health. 

In Alzheimer’s Disease, β-amyloid accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation were linked to metabolic reprogramming in brain cells, shifting to aerobic glycolysis. The authors suggest targeting shared metabolic pathways may mitigate these conditions, and note preliminary evidence from animal and some clinical models for neuroprotective effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists, metformin, and SIRT1 inducers.

The review concludes by encouraging further research into prevention/treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and drug repurposing. No conflicts of interest were declared.

 Statement Text: Fasting purifies brain function by reducing toxicity. 
 Evidence Summary: **Study:** Zheng et al. (2019) *Frontiers in Neuroscience*

**Methods:** This study investigated the impact of 9-hour acute fasting on cognitive function in mice. Researchers used behavioral tests – buried food test, open field test, and Y maze – to assess natural and learned behaviors. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure c-Fos (neuronal activation marker) and caspase-3 (apoptosis marker) expression in brain tissue.

**Population:** The study used a mouse model.

**Key Outcomes:** Fasting increased latency to find buried food. It also increased total distance traveled and decreased freezing time in the open field test, and increased time spent in the novel arm of the Y maze. Immunohistochemistry showed increased c-Fos levels in the hippocampus, PVT, DMH, LH, and BMA, but no caspase-3 activation was observed.

**Effect Size:** The study reports changes in behavioral test metrics (latency, distance, time) and c-Fos expression levels, but does not quantify effect sizes.

**Limitations:** The study is limited to a mouse model; results may not translate directly to humans. The study only examined a single duration of fasting (9 hours).

 Statement Text: Fasting purifies brain function by reducing toxicity. 
 Evidence Summary: This systematic review examined the effectiveness of multimodal non-pharmacological interventions for improving cognitive function in people with dementia. Researchers conducted a comprehensive search, including grey literature, and identified 26 studies – 21 group studies and 5 case studies – meeting the inclusion criteria of a primary dementia diagnosis and use of two or more intervention modes.

Interventions included cognitive, physical, psychological, psychosocial, nutritional, and lifestyle approaches (e.g., sleep hygiene, stress reduction). Group studies used two to three intervention modes. Case studies involved highly personalised treatments utilising up to nine modes, based on in-depth assessments.

Results from the 21 group studies indicated cognitive improvements, stability, or delayed decline in 19 (90%) of comparisons. The extent of clinically meaningful change varied. The review notes the interventions address multiple modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline. 

The review is limited by the variability in study designs and the diverse conceptualisations of ‘multimodal’ interventions, necessitating a developed typology for classification.

 Statement Text: Fasting purifies brain function by reducing toxicity. 
 Evidence Summary: This review article examines the relationship between augmenting brain metabolism and autophagy – specifically macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) – as a potential strategy to reduce neuronal proteotoxicity and aging. The authors reviewed evidence connecting these autophagic mechanisms to ketone bodies, caloric restriction, and exercise. 

The review integrates findings from studies across model organisms, including *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, to demonstrate conserved autophagic responses to metabolic perturbations. It highlights that both macroautophagy and CMA are crucial for neuronal protein quality control, and dysfunction in either contributes to neurodegeneration and aging. 

The authors propose that lifestyle interventions modulating ketone bodies, energy intake, and expenditure may enhance autophagy and promote brain health. The review aims to provide a basis for potential therapeutic strategies to intervene in neuronal decline by favorably controlling macroautophagy and CMA flux. 

This is a review article and does not present original research data, effect sizes, or specific limitations of primary studies.

 Evidence Summary: **Study Summary: Dietary Composition and Alzheimer’s Pathology in TgCRND8 Mice**

This study investigated the impact of dietary composition on amyloid pathology and neuronal integrity in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (TgCRND8 mice). From 4 to 18 weeks of age, mice were fed one of four diets: regular chow, high fat/low carbohydrate, high protein/low carbohydrate, or high carbohydrate/low fat. Brains were analyzed at 18 weeks for wet weight, solubilizable amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels, plaque burden, and neuronal density/volume in the hippocampus.

Results showed that a high-fat diet increased solubilizable Abeta levels, but did not affect plaque burden. Mice on a high-protein/low-carbohydrate diet had brains 5% lighter than other groups. Stereological analysis revealed a trend towards lower neuronal density and volume in the CA3 region of the hippocampus in mice fed the high-protein/low-carbohydrate diet, compared to those on regular chow. No differences were seen in CA1 or the dentate gyrus.

The study suggests a dissociation between changes in Abeta and brain mass, indicating diet may influence neuronal vulnerability independently of amyloid deposition. The authors note that without a comparison group of non-transgenic mice, it's unclear how much of the observed brain mass loss is due to interaction between diet and amyloid pathology.

 Statement Text: Fasting for a minimum of 24 hours raises ketone levels, improves metabolism, and increases willpower. 
 Evidence Summary: This mixed-methods study evaluated the acceptability of “Gambling Habit Hacker,” a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) designed for individuals with gambling problems. Researchers recruited 25 adults with problem gambling via online advertisements. Participants used the JITAI for one week, then completed qualitative interviews.

Quantitative data included system usage metrics. Qualitative data, gathered through semi-structured interviews (n=25), explored user experiences and perceptions of the intervention’s content and functionality. 

Results indicated high levels of engagement with the JITAI. Participants reported the content was relevant, useful, and delivered at appropriate times. Key themes from interviews included perceived helpfulness of personalized feedback, the convenience of mobile delivery, and suggestions for further refinement of the intervention’s features.

Limitations noted include the small sample size and recruitment via online advertisements, potentially limiting generalizability. The one-week usage period also restricts conclusions about long-term acceptability and effectiveness.

 Statement Text: Fasting for a minimum of 24 hours raises ketone levels, improves metabolism, and increases willpower. 
 Evidence Summary: This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the prevalence and risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. The researchers searched PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. Ten observational studies encompassing 8,620 participants were included.

The pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation was 16% (95% CI: 12%, 19%), and the pooled prevalence of suicide attempts was 10% (95% CI: 6%, 13%). Higher prevalence of both outcomes was observed after implementation of the HSTP II program, while lower prevalence was found in adolescents aged 10-19 years. 

Significant factors associated with both suicidal ideation and attempts included gender, disappointment with school results, family history, alcohol use, lack of family/social support, history of abuse, living arrangement, anxiety, and depression. Evidence of publication bias was found for suicide attempts, but not for suicidal ideation. Sensitivity analysis showed no studies significantly altered the overall confidence intervals. The Cochrane Q test and I² statistics indicated substantial heterogeneity among the included studies.

 Statement Text: Fasting for a minimum of 24 hours raises ketone levels, improves metabolism, and increases willpower. 
 Evidence Summary: This case report details three siblings from a Chinese family diagnosed with type I sialidosis, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the *NEU1* gene. The patients presented with seizures and ataxia during adolescence, with symptoms progressively worsening. 

Methods included clinical assessment, and whole exome sequencing to identify the causative genetic mutation. Sequencing revealed a homozygous *NEU1* mutation (NM_000434.3:c.544A>G [p.Ser182Gly]) in all three affected siblings. Parents and children were heterozygous carriers, but asymptomatic. Diagnosis was confirmed via genetic testing.

Key outcomes: the report confirms the genetic basis of sialidosis in these patients. All three siblings were diagnosed with type I sialidosis and treated with antiseizure medications, however seizures continued. 

Limitations: this is a case report describing only three individuals, which limits generalizability. The report does not detail the severity of ataxia, or other clinical features beyond seizures. It focuses on diagnosis and does not evaluate the long-term effects of treatment. Ethics approval was obtained and informed consent received from the family.

 Evidence Summary: This study protocol describes a randomized, double-masked, single-center clinical trial comparing micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (MP-TSCPC) with slow coagulation transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (SC-TSCPC) in patients with refractory glaucoma. 

The study will enroll patients aged 18 years or older with corrected visual acuity ≤20/60 and intraocular pressure (IOP) >21 mmHg. Participants will be randomized to either MP-TSCPC or SC-TSCPC. Follow-up examinations will occur at 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 3, 6, and 12 months post-procedure. 

Outcomes will assess IOP reduction and include a definition of ‘complete success’ (IOP 6-20 mmHg and ≥30% IOP reduction from baseline, without hypotensive medications) and ‘qualified success’ (same parameters, allowing medication use). Examinations will include visual acuity, IOP measurement, biomicroscopy, fundoscopy, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). The number of hypotensive medications and complications will also be recorded. 

The trial was registered retrospectively (RBR-5pckbhj) and approved by the University of Campinas Ethics Committee in May 2023. One investigator (VPC) reports financial conflicts of interest with Alcon, Allergan-Abbvie, Iridex, and Zeiss.

Evidence: This study investigated the effects of time-restricted feeding (TRF – a 16:8 regimen) on health and lifespan using *Drosophila melanogaster* (fruit flies). Researchers assessed lifespan, reproductive output (fecundity), gut health (intestinal stem cell proliferation and epithelial barrier integrity), and gut microbiota composition.  TRF significantly extended lifespan, even when implemented during early adulthood. This longevity benefit was observed *without* negatively impacting reproductive fitness. TRF also improved gut health in aged flies by reducing stem cell proliferation and enhancing barrier integrity. Analysis of the gut microbiota revealed a shift in composition, with an increase in gram-negative bacteria following TRF.   The study suggests TRF may promote healthy longevity through mechanisms like metabolic reprogramming or increased autophagy. Authors declare no conflicts of interest.

{'transcript': "Did you know that starving yourself can reverse your age, repair damaged cells, and increase your brain power with just one easy health hack? It sounds so unrealistic you would think I'm lying to you. But I'm not! I'm not lying! These are all recorded benefits of fasting. There are literally tons of religions and ancient cultures that practice fasting as a way to regulate health, discipline, and spirit. And modern science proves that they were onto something. Ancient divine wisdom and nerds in lab coats agreeing on something being good for you should be all the evidence that you need. And here's what we know that fasting can do for you. Discard old and damaged cells and replace them with new ones. Purifies your brain function with less toxicity flowing through your body. Raises your willpower because it's a form of discipline training. Raises your ketone levels and helps with metabolism. And obviously if you're not eating as much, you're going to lose weight. And the research varies on how long you're supposed to fast for, but to get these types of benefits, it sounds like the minimum is 24 hours. I go anywhere from 36 to 48 and I do it once a week.
