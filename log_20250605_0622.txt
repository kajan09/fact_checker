 STEP2:

You are part of a medical fact-checking pipeline.  
If you propagate a false statement, the app may mislead people.

INPUT TRANSCRIPT
---------------
{transcript}
---------------

TASK  
Extract **medical claims** suitable for fact-checking.

SELECTION RULES  
1. Return **exactly three** distinct claims.  
2. Prefer clinically relevant, novel, or potentially harmful claims.  
3. Discard greetings, jokes, moral or motivational advice, rhetorical questions, non-medical content, or data too vague to be verified.  
4. Merge duplicate / near-duplicate claims into one concise statement.

STRICT OUTPUT  
A valid JSON array with 1–3 strings.  
No commentary, no extra keys, no markdown.




 STEP3:

You are a biomedical librarian inside a fact‐checking app.  
If the claim is too vague, non‐medical, or otherwise unlikely to be indexed in PubMed, output the single word: NONE

Otherwise, **think quickly (silently)** about the core PICO concepts in the claim, identify appropriate MeSH headings (in quotes with [MeSH]) and text‐word synonyms (with [tiab]), and produce ONE PubMed Boolean query string that:
Example:
(
  "Smoking"[MeSH] 
  OR smoking[tiab] 
  OR smokers[tiab] 
  OR "tobacco use"[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Lung Function Tests"[MeSH] 
  OR "pulmonary function"[tiab] 
  OR "lung function"[tiab] 
  OR FEV1[tiab] 
  OR FVC[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Inflammation"[MeSH] 
  OR inflammation[tiab] 
  OR "mucus hypersecretion"[tiab] 
  OR mucus[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Proanthocyanidins"[MeSH] 
  OR proanthocyanidin*[tiab] 
  OR OPC[tiab] 
  OR "Traumotein"[tiab] 
  OR "pine bark extract"[tiab] 
  OR Pycnogenol[tiab]
)


• Is exactly one line (no line breaks).  
• Uses uppercase AND/OR to combine concepts.  
• Wraps MeSH terms in quotes followed by [MeSH] (e.g., "Smoking"[MeSH]).  
• Marks synonym or free‐text terms with [tiab] (e.g., smoking[tiab]).  
• Groups synonyms with parentheses; groups PICO domains by combining with AND.  
• Does not include field tags other than [MeSH] and [tiab].  
• Does not include quotation marks around free‐text terms (other than MeSH).  
• Begins with a letter (A–Z or a–z) and contains no leading/trailing spaces.  
• Contains no line breaks or extra whitespace.

CLAIM:
{claim}




 STEP5:

You are summarising evidence for a medical fact-checker.  
Think briefly (silently) about study design and main results, then write the summary.

GUIDELINES  
• ≤ 300 words, plain text.  
• Focus on methods, population, key outcomes, effect sizes, and limitations.  
• Do NOT add interpretation beyond the abstract itself.

TEXT TO SUMMARISE
-----------------
{abstract}
-----------------




 STEP6:

You are verifying whether the summary actually addresses the claim.  
Think (silently) first; then answer in exactly one word.

STATEMENT: {statement}

EVIDENCE SUMMARY: {evidence_summary}

Does the summary *directly relate to or support* the statement?
Respond with only: yes   |   no




 STEP7:

You are a professional medical fact-checker.  
A wrong verdict could spread misinformation, so think carefully (silently) before answering.

TASK  
Decide whether the provided abstracts collectively SUPPORT, REFUTE, or leave UNCERTAIN the claim.

Give your kid butter before bed. It's the epic bedtime hack you've probably never heard of. Does your little one wake up multiple times a night? Yep, that was my life when my son was 12 months old. However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Alright, ready? Before bed, I started offering my son a spoonful of butter. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I felt like he was still hungry and I wanted to make sure he was getting enough calories before bedtime. And guess what? It worked like a charm. He went from waking up multiple times a night to a full night's sleep. It was a game changer, all because of butter. Now, why is this helpful? It's not uncommon for our growing babies to need more calories. Brains are rapidly developing and bodies growing bigger. If kids don't get enough calories during the day, their blood sugar can drop overnight and they'll wake up hungry and cry. Since they can't communicate their hunger, they will simply just cry. So often the only thing that will console them is the middle of the night, nursing session, or a bottle. Does that make sense? Alright, now, I can't guarantee that this will work for every child, but it's worth a try if you're feeling desperate for some sleep. And no, it does not need to be butter. It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk. Get creative. Choose something that is easy, that your child will eat and they'll love. Now, if you've already tried it and it worked for you, please share your experience in the comments below. I love hearing from other moms sharing their tips with each other. Just a reminder, every child's different. You know your baby best. Trust your instincts. And if it doesn't work for you, then we could try something else. Something.

LLM output: This mixed-methods study evaluated the acceptability of “Gambling Habit Hacker,” a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) designed for individuals with gambling problems. Researchers recruited 25 adults experiencing gambling harm. Participants used the JITAI for one week, then completed qualitative interviews.

Quantitative data, collected via system usage data, showed high rates of engagement with the app’s features. 88% of participants completed >50% of prompted checks-ins. Qualitative interviews explored user experiences, identifying key themes around perceived usefulness, personalization, and usability. Participants generally found the JITAI acceptable and potentially helpful for managing urges and modifying gambling-related habits. 

Limitations noted include the small sample size and the short duration of intervention use, which limits assessment of sustained engagement or long-term effects. The sample was recruited from treatment-seeking individuals, potentially limiting generalizability to the wider population of people experiencing gambling harm.

INTRODUCTION: Suicide is a major public health problem and one of the top causes of death among adolescents worldwide. The Ethiopian government works to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being in adolescents through the National Adolescent and Youth Mental Health Strategy. Despite these efforts, suicide in adolescents remains pressing in Ethiopia; however, study findings regarding suicidal ideation and suicide attempts and their associated factors in high school adolescents have been inconsistent and non-conclusive. Therefore, this review aimed to assess the pooled national prevalence and risk factors of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guideline was followed for this systematic review. We searched PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases. We included all observational studies that report the prevalence and associated factors of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. Using a standard data extraction format, two authors separately extracted all required data. The meta-analysis was conducted using Stata version 17 statistical software. The Cochrane Q test and I² statistics were employed to evaluate the heterogeneity among the included studies. Pooled prevalence estimates, along with their 95% confidence intervals, were calculated using a random-effects model. Potential sources of heterogeneity across studies were further explored through subgroup analyses, sensitivity analysis, and meta-regression analysis. RESULT: The review comprised ten studies with 8,620 participants. Out of 1,451 studies identified, 10 studies were included in the analysis. As the random effect model indicated that the pooled prevalence of suicide ideation and suicide attempt among high school adolescents in Ethiopia was 16% (95% CI: 12%, 19%) and 10% (95% CI: 6%, 13%), respectively. The highest prevalence of suicidal ideation was observed after the country's implementation of HSTP II [18 (95% CI: 15-22), I²=83.94, P-value < 0.001], while the lowest prevalence was depicted in adolescents aged 10-19 years [11% (95% CI 10, 13), I²=93.3, P-value < 0.001]. Similarly, the highest pooled prevalence of suicide attempt was observed after the country's implementation of HSTP II [12% (95% CI: 10-13), I²=67.77, P-value < 0.03], while the lowest prevalence was depicted in adolescents aged 10-19 years [5% (95% CI 1, 9), I²=94.43, P-value < 0.001]. The sensitivity analysis indicated that none of the point estimates were outside of the overall 95% confidence interval. No publication bias was seen in suicide ideation. But evidence of publication bias for suicide attempts was identified through the left trim and fill analysis. Gender, disappointment with school results, family history, alcohol use, the presence or absence of family or social support, history of abuse, living arrangement of adolescent, anxiety, and depression were significantly associated with suicide ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. CONCLUSION: This review revealed that a significant proportion of high school adolescents had suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in Ethiopia. Therefore, the government and all stakeholders should track the outcome of the suicide prevention project under HSTP II and other initiatives. In addition, emphasis should be given to disadvantaged adolescents, including females, orphans, alcohol users, and mentally challenged adolescents. Furthermore, school-based interventions like social support and suicide prevention initiatives shall be promoted. © 2025. The Author(s).

LLM output: This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the prevalence and risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. The researchers searched PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. Ten observational studies comprising 8,620 participants were included.

The pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation was 16% (95% CI: 12%, 19%), and the pooled prevalence of suicide attempts was 10% (95% CI: 6%, 13%). Higher prevalence of both was observed after implementation of the HSTP II program. The lowest prevalence for both outcomes was observed in adolescents aged 10-19 years. 

Significant heterogeneity was found across studies (I² values ranging from 67.77 to 94.43, P<0.05). Sensitivity analysis showed point estimates remained within the 95% confidence interval. Publication bias was detected for suicide attempts but not for ideation. 

Factors significantly associated with both suicidal ideation and attempts included gender, disappointment with school results, family history of mental health issues, alcohol use, lack of social/family support, history of abuse, living arrangements, anxiety, and depression.

(#)Contributed equally BACKGROUND: Sialidosis is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease characterized by the mutation of neuraminidase-1 (NEU1) gene, resulting in decreased activity of α-N-acetylneuraminidase. This leads to metabolic abnormalities in various organs. Sialidosis is classified into two distinct clinical phenotypes, type I and type II, based on the age of onset and severity of clinical manifestations. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a case involving a patient and his two sisters, all of whom showed seizures and ataxia during adolescence, with progressively worsening symptoms. Prior to admission, none of the patients had received a systemic diagnosis or treatment. The whole exome sequencing identified a homozygous NEU1 mutation (NM_000434.3:c.544A > G [p.Ser182Gly]) in all three siblings. Their parents and children, who were asymptomatic, were found to be heterozygous carriers. The three patients were ultimately diagnosed with type I sialidosis and treated with antiseizure medications, but they continued to experience recurrent seizures. CONCLUSIONS: This case report enhances our understanding of sialidosis, particularly in patients presenting with seizures and ataxia. Furthermore, the gene sequencing is a crucial tool for confirming the diagnosis of sialidosis and provides a valuable approach for genetic counseling in affected families. © 2025. The Author(s).

LLM output: This case report details three siblings from a Chinese family diagnosed with type I sialidosis, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the *NEU1* gene. The patients presented with seizures and ataxia during adolescence, with progressively worsening symptoms. 

Methods included clinical assessment, and whole exome sequencing to identify the causative genetic mutation. Sequencing revealed a homozygous *NEU1* mutation (NM_000434.3:c.544A>G [p.Ser182Gly]) in all three affected siblings. Parents and children were found to be heterozygous carriers. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee and informed consent was obtained from the family.

Key outcomes: Genetic sequencing confirmed the diagnosis of type I sialidosis. All three patients were treated with antiseizure medications, but continued to experience recurrent seizures. 

Limitations: This is a case report of three individuals, and therefore does not provide data on prevalence, incidence, or treatment efficacy in a larger population. The report focuses on clinical and genetic findings, without detailing long-term outcomes or response to alternative therapies.

Micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation versus slow coagulation in refractory glaucoma: study protocol of a randomized clinical trial. de Lima Neto CR(1), de Cabral Vasconcellos JP(2), Silva SGNE(2), Costa VP(2). Author information: (1)Department of Ophthalmology, University of Campinas, 251 Vital Brazil St, Campinas, São Paulo, 13083-888, Brazil. cesarlimaneto@yahoo.com.br. (2)Department of Ophthalmology, University of Campinas, 251 Vital Brazil St, Campinas, São Paulo, 13083-888, Brazil. BACKGROUND: Traditional continuous diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TCW-TSCPC) has been used for decades to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) by decreasing aqueous humor (AH) production in patients with glaucoma. Micropulse cyclophotocoagulation (MP-TSCPC) and slow coagulation (SC-TSCPC) are the newest transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TSCPC) techniques that result in lower inflammation and complication rates compared to the traditional technique. Most publications on TSCPC are case series with a retrospective design with different treatment protocols. The objective of this manuscript is to describe the protocol of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) designed to compare the efficacy and safety of MP-TSCPC and SC-TSCPC in patients with refractory glaucoma followed for 12 months. METHODS: This is a parallel, double-arm single-center, double-masked, RCT that will include eyes with refractory glaucoma. Patients with corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ≤ 20/60, IOP > 21 mmHg, and age ≥ 18 years will be randomized to cyclophotocoagulation using the SC-TSCPC or MP-TSCPC techniques. Follow-up visits will be 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 3, 6, and 12 months after the procedure. Complete success will be defined as an IOP between 6 and 20 mmHg and a minimum of 30% IOP reduction from baseline, without hypotensive medications. Qualified success will be defined by the same parameters but allowing the use of medication. All follow-up examinations will include determination of BCVA, IOP measurement, slit lamp biomicroscopy, fundoscopy, and macular optical coherence tomography (OCT). The number of hypotensive medications and the occurrence of complications will also be documented. DISCUSSION: Our study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of the two most used TSCPC techniques. Most published studies are retrospective and compare the two new techniques only with the traditional technique. This is, to our knowledge, the first RCT comparing MP-TSCPC and SC-TSCPC techniques.

LLM output: This study protocol describes a randomized, double-masked, single-center clinical trial comparing micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (MP-TSCPC) to slow coagulation transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (SC-TSCPC) in patients with refractory glaucoma. 

The trial will enroll patients aged 18 or older with corrected visual acuity ≤20/60, intraocular pressure (IOP) >21 mmHg. Participants will be randomized to either MP-TSCPC or SC-TSCPC. Follow-up examinations will occur at 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 3, 6, and 12 months post-procedure.

The primary outcome is complete success, defined as IOP between 6-20 mmHg and a ≥30% IOP reduction from baseline, without hypotensive medications. Qualified success is defined similarly, but allows for medication use.  Follow-up assessments will include best-corrected visual acuity, IOP measurement, slit lamp biomicroscopy, fundoscopy, and macular optical coherence tomography (OCT).  The number of hypotensive medications used and complication rates will also be documented. 

The study is registered at the Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clínicos (ReBEC) RBR-5pckbhj and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Campinas. One author reports financial conflicts of interest with Alcon, Allergan-Abbvie, Iridex, and Zeiss.

Participants generally found the JITAI acceptable and potentially helpful for managing urges and modifying gambling-related habits. 

Limitations noted include the small sample size and the short duration of intervention use, which limits assessment of sustained engagement or long-term effects. The sample was recruited from treatment-seeking individuals, potentially limiting generalizability to the wider population of people experiencing gambling harm.

 Statement Text: A high-calorie, fat-rich food before bed can serve as a remedy for nighttime wakings in babies. 
 Evidence Summary: This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the prevalence and risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among high school adolescents in Ethiopia. The researchers searched PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. Ten observational studies comprising 8,620 participants were included.

The pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation was 16% (95% CI: 12%, 19%), and the pooled prevalence of suicide attempts was 10% (95% CI: 6%, 13%). Higher prevalence of both was observed after implementation of the HSTP II program. The lowest prevalence for both outcomes was observed in adolescents aged 10-19 years. 

Significant heterogeneity was found across studies (I² values ranging from 67.77 to 94.43, P<0.05). Sensitivity analysis showed point estimates remained within the 95% confidence interval. Publication bias was detected for suicide attempts but not for ideation. 

Factors significantly associated with both suicidal ideation and attempts included gender, disappointment with school results, family history of mental health issues, alcohol use, lack of social/family support, history of abuse, living arrangements, anxiety, and depression.

 Statement Text: A high-calorie, fat-rich food before bed can serve as a remedy for nighttime wakings in babies. 
 Evidence Summary: This case report details three siblings from a Chinese family diagnosed with type I sialidosis, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the *NEU1* gene. The patients presented with seizures and ataxia during adolescence, with progressively worsening symptoms. 

Methods included clinical assessment, and whole exome sequencing to identify the causative genetic mutation. Sequencing revealed a homozygous *NEU1* mutation (NM_000434.3:c.544A>G [p.Ser182Gly]) in all three affected siblings. Parents and children were found to be heterozygous carriers. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee and informed consent was obtained from the family.

Key outcomes: Genetic sequencing confirmed the diagnosis of type I sialidosis. All three patients were treated with antiseizure medications, but continued to experience recurrent seizures. 

Limitations: This is a case report of three individuals, and therefore does not provide data on prevalence, incidence, or treatment efficacy in a larger population. The report focuses on clinical and genetic findings, without detailing long-term outcomes or response to alternative therapies.

 Statement Text: A high-calorie, fat-rich food before bed can serve as a remedy for nighttime wakings in babies. 
 Evidence Summary: This study protocol describes a randomized, double-masked, single-center clinical trial comparing micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (MP-TSCPC) to slow coagulation transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (SC-TSCPC) in patients with refractory glaucoma. 

The trial will enroll patients aged 18 or older with corrected visual acuity ≤20/60, intraocular pressure (IOP) >21 mmHg. Participants will be randomized to either MP-TSCPC or SC-TSCPC. Follow-up examinations will occur at 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 3, 6, and 12 months post-procedure.

The primary outcome is complete success, defined as IOP between 6-20 mmHg and a ≥30% IOP reduction from baseline, without hypotensive medications. Qualified success is defined similarly, but allows for medication use.  Follow-up assessments will include best-corrected visual acuity, IOP measurement, slit lamp biomicroscopy, fundoscopy, and macular optical coherence tomography (OCT).  The number of hypotensive medications used and complication rates will also be documented. 

The study is registered at the Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clínicos (ReBEC) RBR-5pckbhj and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Campinas. One author reports financial conflicts of interest with Alcon, Allergan-Abbvie, Iridex, and Zeiss.

{'transcript': "Give your kid butter before bed. It's the epic bedtime hack you've probably never heard of. Does your little one wake up multiple times a night? Yep, that was my life when my son was 12 months old. However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Alright, ready? Before bed, I started offering my son a spoonful of butter. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I felt like he was still hungry and I wanted to make sure he was getting enough calories before bedtime. And guess what? It worked like a charm. He went from waking up multiple times a night to a full night's sleep. It was a game changer, all because of butter. Now, why is this helpful? It's not uncommon for our growing babies to need more calories. Brains are rapidly developing and bodies growing bigger. If kids don't get enough calories during the day, their blood sugar can drop overnight and they'll wake up hungry and cry. Since they can't communicate their hunger, they will simply just cry. So often the only thing that will console them is the middle of the night, nursing session, or a bottle. Does that make sense? Alright, now, I can't guarantee that this will work for every child, but it's worth a try if you're feeling desperate for some sleep. And no, it does not need to be butter. It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk. Get creative. Choose something that is easy, that your child will eat and they'll love. Now, if you've already tried it and it worked for you, please share your experience in the comments below. I love hearing from other moms sharing their tips with each other. Just a reminder, every child's different. You know your baby best. Trust your instincts. And if it doesn't work for you, then we could try something else.
